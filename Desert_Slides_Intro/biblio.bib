All the methodological details can be found in the article.Abstract:Drylands may shift between healthy and degraded states in response to climatic changes or anthropogenic disturbances. These shifts are unannounced and difficult to reverse once they happen, thus their prompt detection is of crucial importance. The distribution of vegetation patch sizes may indicate the proximity to these shifts, but their use is hampered by the lack of large-scale studies relating them to multifunctionality (the provision of multiple ecosystem functions) and comparing them to other ecosystem attributes such as total plant cover. Here we overcome these limitations by sampling 115 dryland communities across the globe and relating their vegetation attributes (cover and patch-size distributions) to multifunctionality. This latter variable followed a bimodal distribution, which suggests contrasting multifunctionality states in global drylands. Although plant cover was most strongly related to multifunctionality, only patch-size distributions identified the bimodality found in its distribution. The uncoupling between different nutrient cycles and the loss of self-organizing biotic processes were identified as the mechanisms underlying the multifunctionality states observed. Our findings support the use of vegetation patterns as functional indicators in drylands, and pave the way for developing effective strategies to monitor desertification processes in global drylands.},

	abstract = {Self-organized spatial patterns are a common feature of complex systems, ranging from microbial communities to mussel beds and drylands. While the theoretical implications of these patterns for ecosystem-level processes, such as functioning and resilience, have been extensively studied, empirical evidence remains scarce. To address this gap, we analyzed global drylands along an aridity gradient using remote sensing, field data, and modeling. We found that the spatial structure of the vegetation strengthens as aridity increases, which is associated with the maintenance of a high level of soil multifunctionality, even as aridity levels rise up to a certain threshold. The combination of these results with those of two individual-based models indicate that self-organized vegetation patterns not only form in response to stressful environmental conditions but also provide drylands with the ability to adapt to changing conditions while maintaining their functioning, an adaptive capacity which is lost in degraded ecosystems. Self-organization thereby plays a vital role in enhancing the resilience of drylands. Overall, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between spatial vegetation patterns and dryland resilience. They also represent a significant step forward in the development of indicators for ecosystem resilience, which are critical tools for managing and preserving these valuable ecosystems in a warmer and more arid world.},

          Species are wrapped in a set of feedbacks within communities and with their abiotic environment, which can can generate alternative stable states. So far, research on alternative stable states has mostly focused on systems with a small number of species and a limited diversity of interaction types. Here, we analyze a spatial model of plant community dynamics in drylands, where each species is characterized by a strategy, and interact through facilitation and competition. Our work identifies three different types of multistability emerging from the interplay of competition and facilitation. Under low-stress levels, the community organizes in small groups of coexisting species maintained by space and facilitation, while under higher stress levels, positive feedbacks from competition and facilitation lead to the dominance of a single species before desertification happens. Our study paves the way for bridging community ecology and alternative states theory in a common framework.},

We conducted a global systematic survey and found FC-like vegetation patterns in 263 sites from 15 countries and three continents, including the Sahel, Madagascar, and Middle-West Asia. FC-like vegetation patterns are found in environments characterized by a unique combination of soil (including low nutrient levels and high sand content) and climatic (arid regions with high temperatures and high precipitation seasonality) conditions. In addition to these factors, the presence of specific biological elements (termite nests) in certain regions also plays a role in the presence of these patterns. Furthermore, areas with FC-like vegetation patterns also showed more stable temporal productivity patterns than those of surrounding areas. Our study presents a global atlas of FCs and provides unique insights into the ecology and biogeography of these fascinating vegetation patterns.},

	abstract = {The spatial structure of seagrass landscapes is typically ascribed to the direct influence of physical factors such as hydrodynamics, light, and sediment transport. We studied regularly interspaced banded patterns, formed by elongated patches of seagrass, in a small-scale intertidal ecosystem. We investigated (1) whether the observed spatial patterns may arise from feedback interactions between seagrass and its abiotic environment and (2) whether changes in abiotic conditions may lead to predictable changes in these spatial patterns. Field measurements, experiments, and a spatially explicit computer model identified a “scale-dependent feedback” (a mechanism for spatial self-organization) as a possible cause for the banded patterns. Increased protection from uprooting by improved anchoring with increasing seagrass density caused a local positive feedback. Sediment erosion around seagrass shoots increased with distance through the seagrass bands, hence causing a long-range negative feedback. Measurements across the depth gradient of the intertidal, together with model simulations, demonstrated that seagrass cover and mean patch size were predictably influenced by additional external stress caused by light limitation and desiccation. Thus, our study provides direct empirical evidence for a consistent response of spatial self-organized patterns to changing abiotic conditions, suggesting a potential use for self-organized spatial patterns as stress indicators in ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Predicting the risk of critical transitions, such as the collapse of a population, is important in order to direct management efforts. In any system that is close to a critical transition, recovery upon small perturbations becomes slow, a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. It has been suggested that such slowing down may be detected indirectly through an increase in spatial and temporal correlation and variance. Here, we tested this idea in arid ecosystems, where vegetation may collapse to desert as a result of increasing water limitation. We used three models that describe desertification but differ in the spatial vegetation patterns they produce. In all models, recovery rate upon perturbation decreased before vegetation collapsed. However, in one of the models, slowing down failed to translate into rising variance and correlation. This is caused by the regular self-organized vegetation patterns produced by this model. This finding implies an important limitation of variance and correlation as indicators of critical transitions. However, changes in such self-organized patterns themselves are a reliable indicator of an upcoming transition. Our results illustrate that while critical slowing down may be a universal phenomenon at critical transitions, its detection through indirect indicators may have limitations in particular systems.},

Both theory and experimental evidence support the idea that ecological interactions may affect co-occurrence, but it remains unclear to what extent the signal of interaction can be captured in observational data. It is now time to step back from the statistical developments and critically assess whether co-occurrence data are really a proxy for ecological interactions. In this paper, we present a series of arguments based on probability, sampling, food web and coexistence theories supporting that signiﬁcant spatial associations between species (or lack thereof) is a poor proxy for ecological interactions.

Mutualisms occur in every terrestrial and aquatic habitat; indeed, ecologists now believe that almost every species on Earth is involved directly or indirectly in one or more of these interactions. Mutualisms are essential to the reproduction and survival of virtually all organisms, as well as to nutrient cycles in ecosystems.

Supporting the fundamental nature of this temperature niche, current production of crops and livestock is largely limited to the same conditions, and the same optimum has been found for agricultural and nonagricultural economic output of countries through analyses of year-to-year variation.

Although there has been important work on mechanisms of decline in some species, it generally remains unclear which changes in climate actually cause extinctions, and how many species will likely be lost. Here, we identify the specific changes in climate that are associated with the widespread local extinctions that have already occurred. We then use this information to predict the extent of future biodiversity loss and to identify which processes may forestall extinction. We used data from surveys of 538 plant and animal species over time, 44\% of which have already had local extinctions at one or more sites. We found that locations with local extinctions had larger and faster changes in hottest yearly temperatures than those without. Surprisingly, sites with local extinctions had significantly smaller changes in mean annual temperatures, despite the widespread use of mean annual temperatures as proxies for overall climate change. Based on their past rates of dispersal, we estimate that 57–70\% of these 538 species will not disperse quickly enough to avoid extinction. However, we show that niche shifts appear to be far more important for avoiding extinction than dispersal, although most studies focus only on dispersal. Specifically, considering both dispersal and niche shifts, we project that only 16–30\% of these 538 species may go extinct by 2070. Overall, our results help identify the specific climatic changes that cause extinction and the processes that may help species to survive.},

	abstract = {Ecological networks originating as a result of three diﬀerent ecological processes are examined and cross-compared to assess if the underlying ecological processes in these systems produce considerable diﬀerence in the structure of the networks. Absence of any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the structure of the networks may indicate towards the possibility of a universal structural pattern in these ecological networks. The underlying graphs of the networks derived by the ecological processes, namely host-parasite interaction, plant pollination and seed dispersion are all bipartite graphs and thus several algebraic structural measures fail to distinguish between the structure of these networks. In this work we use weighted spectral distribution (WSD) of normalized graph Laplacian, which have been eﬀectively used earlier to discriminate graphs with diﬀerent topologies, to investigate the possibility of existence of structural dissimilarity in these networks. Graph spectrum is often considered a signature of the graph and WSD of the graph Laplacian is shown to be related to the distribution of some small subgraphs in a graph and hence represent the global structure of a network. We use random projections of WSD to R2 and R3 and establish that the structure of plant pollinator networks is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent as compared to host-parasite and seed dispersal networks. The structures of host parasite networks and seed dispersal networks are found to be identical. Furthermore, we use some algebraic structural measures in order to quantify the diﬀerences as well as similarities observed in the structure of the three kinds of networks. We thus infer that our work suggests an absence of a universal structural pattern in these three diﬀerent kinds of networks.},

We develop generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that estimate the effect of both parties’ phylogenetic history on trait evolution, both in isolation but also in terms of how the two histories interact. Using data on the incidence and abundance of 206 ﬂea species on 121 mammal species, we illustrate our method and compare it to previously used methods for detecting host-parasite coevolution. At large spatial scales we ﬁnd that the phylogenetic interaction effect was substantial, indicating that related parasite species were more likely to be found on related host species. At smaller spatial scales, and when sampling effort was not controlled for, phylogenetic effects on the number and types of parasite species harbored by hosts were found to dominate. We go on to show that in situations where these additional phylogenetic effects exist, then previous methods have very high Type I error rates when testing for the phylogenetic interaction. Our GLMM method represents a robust and reliable approach to quantify the phylogenetic effects of traits determined by, or deﬁned by, ecological interactions and has the advantage that it can easily be extended and interpreted in a broader context than existing permutation tests.},

Here we build an individual-based eco-evolutionary model for the emergence of mutualistic, antagonistic and neutral bipartite interaction networks. Exploring networks evolved under these scenarios, we ﬁnd three main results. First, antagonistic interactions tend to foster species and trait diversity, while mutualistic interactions reduce diversity. Second, antagonistic interactors evolve higher specialisation, which results in networks that are often more modular than neutral ones; resource species in these networks often display phylogenetic conservatism in interaction partners. Third, mutualistic interactions lead to networks that are more nested than neutral ones, with low phylogenetic conservatism in interaction partners. These results tend to match overall empirical trends, demonstrating that structures of empirical networks that have most often been explained by ecological processes can result from an evolutionary emergence. Our model contributes to the ongoing effort of better integrating ecological interactions and macroevolution.},

	abstract = {Mutualistic networks involving plants and their pollinators or frugivores have been shown recently to exhibit a particular asymmetrical organization of interactions among species called nestedness: a core of reciprocal generalists accompanied by specialist species that interact almost exclusively with generalists. This structure contrasts with compartmentalized assemblage structures that have been verified in antagonistic food webs. Here we evaluated whether nestedness is a property of another type of mutualism—the interactions between ants and extrafloral nectary-bearing plants—and whether species richness may lead to differences in degree of nestedness among biological communities. We investigated network structure in four communities in Mexico. Nested patterns in ant–plant networks were very similar to those previously reported for pollination and frugivore systems, indicating that this form of asymmetry in specialization is a common feature of mutualisms between free-living species, but not always present in species-poor systems. Other ecological factors also appeared to contribute to the nested asymmetry in specialization, because some assemblages showed more extreme asymmetry than others even when species richness was held constant. Our results support a promising approach for the development of multispecies coevolutionary theory, leading to the idea that specialization may coevolve in different but simple ways in antagonistic and mutualistic assemblages.},

The commonly observed pattern of links between specialists and generalists in these networks has been predicted to promote species coexistence. Plants also build highly species-rich mutualistic networks below ground with root-associated fungi, and the structure of these plant–fungus networks may also affect terrestrial community processes. By compiling high-throughput DNA sequencing data sets of the symbiosis of plants and their root-associated fungi from three localities along a latitudinal gradient, we uncovered the entire network architecture of these interactions under contrasting environmental conditions. Each network included more than 30 plant species and hundreds of mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi belonging to diverse phylogenetic groups. The results were consistent with the notion that processes shaping host-plant specialization of fungal species generate a unique linkage pattern that strongly contrasts with the pattern of above-ground plant–partner networks. Specifically, plant–fungus networks lacked a “nested” architecture, which has been considered to promote species coexistence in plant–partner networks. Rather, the below-ground networks had a conspicuous “antinested” topology. Our findings lead to the working hypothesis that terrestrial plant community dynamics are likely determined by the balance between above-ground and below-ground webs of interspecific interactions.},

                Bipartite networks are widely-used to represent a diverse range of species interactions, such as pollination, herbivory, parasitism and seed dispersal. The structure of these networks is usually characterised by calculating one or more metrics that capture different aspects of network architecture. While these metrics capture useful properties of networks, they only consider structure at the scale of the whole network (the macro-scale) or individual species (the micro-scale). ‘Meso-scale’ structure between these scales is usually ignored, despite representing ecologically-important interactions. Network motifs are a framework for capturing this meso-scale structure and are gaining in popularity. However, there is no software available in R, the most popular programming language among ecologists, for conducting motif analyses in bipartite networks. Similarly, no mathematical formalisation of bipartite motifs has been developed.
              
              
                Here we introduce bmotif: a package for counting motifs, and species positions within motifs, in bipartite networks. Our code is primarily an R package, but we also provide MATLAB and Python code of the core functionality. The software is based on a mathematical framework where, for the first time, we derive formal expressions for motif frequencies and the frequencies with which species occur in different positions within motifs. This framework means that analyses with bmotif are fast, making motif methods compatible with the permutational approaches often used in network studies, such as null model analyses.
              
              
                We describe the package and demonstrate how it can be used to conduct ecological analyses, using two examples of plant-pollinator networks. We first use motifs to examine the assembly and disassembly of an Arctic plant-pollinator community, and then use them to compare the roles of native and introduced plant species in an unrestored site in Mauritius.
              
              
                bmotif will enable motif analyses of a wide range of bipartite ecological networks, allowing future research to characterise these complex networks without discarding important meso-scale structural detail.},

However, the influence of different types of links, such as cheating links, on network organization remains unexplored. We studied two flower-visitation networks (Malpighiaceae and Bignoniaceae and their flower visitors), and divide the types of link into cheaters (i.e. robbers and thieves of flower rewards) and effective pollinators. We investigated if there were topological differences among networks with and without cheaters, especially with respect to nestedness and modularity. The Malpighiaceae network was nested, but not modular, and it was dominated by pollinators and had much fewer cheater species than Bignoniaceae network (28\% versus 75\%). The Bignoniaceae network was mainly a plant–cheater network, being modular because of the presence of pollen robbers and showing no nestedness. In the Malpighiaceae network, removal of cheaters had no major consequences for topology. In contrast, removal of cheaters broke down the modularity of the Bignoniaceae network. As cheaters are ubiquitous in all mutualisms, the results presented here show that they have a strong impact upon network topology.},

	abstract = {Understanding the causes and effects of network structural features is a key task in deciphering complex systems. In this context, the property of network nestedness has aroused a fair amount of interest as regards ecological networks. Indeed, Bastolla et al. introduced a simple measure of network nestedness which opened the door to analytical understanding, allowing them to conclude that biodiversity is strongly enhanced in highly nested mutualistic networks. Here, we suggest a slightly refined version of such a measure of nestedness and study how it is influenced by the most basic structural properties of networks, such as degree distribution and degree-degree correlations (i.e. assortativity). We find that most of the empirically found nestedness stems from heterogeneity in the degree distribution. Once such an influence has been discounted – as a second factor – we find that nestedness is strongly correlated with disassortativity and hence – as random networks have been recently found to be naturally disassortative – they also tend to be naturally nested just as the result of chance.},

Here we show that this maximization process can be written in terms of the eigenspectrum of a matrix we call the modularity matrix, which plays a role in community detection similar to that played by the graph Laplacian in graph partitioning calculations. This result leads us to a number of possible algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as several other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure in networks and a new centrality measure that identifies those vertices that occupy central positions within the communities to which they belong. The algorithms and measures proposed are illustrated with applications to a variety of real-world complex networks.},

However, no study has yet explored the dynamical implications of network structure for the persistence of such mutualistic communities. Here, we develop a patch-model of a whole plant–animal community and explore its persistence. To assess the role of network structure, we build three versions of the model. In the ﬁrst version, we use the exact network of interactions of two real mutualistic communities. In the other versions, we randomize the observed network of interactions using two different null models. We show that the community response to habitat loss is affected by network structure. Real communities start to decay sooner than random communities, but persist for higher destruction levels. There is a destruction threshold at which the community collapses. Our model is the ﬁrst attempt to describe the dynamics of whole mutualistic metacommunities interacting in realistic ways.},

The information contained in such interaction matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exempliﬁed here by modularity, is difﬁcult to link to speciﬁc causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to speciﬁc interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substantial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on ﬁtness consequences as measured in experimental setups.},

A major question in ecology is whether interaction intimacy also shapes the way interactions are organized within communities. We combined analyses of network structure and food web models to test the role of interaction intimacy in determining patterns of antagonistic interactions, such as host–parasite, predator–prey and plant–herbivore interactions. Networks describing interactions with low intimacy were more connected, more nested and less modular than high-intimacy networks. Moreover, the performance of the models differed across networks with different levels of intimacy. All models reproduced well low-intimacy networks, whereas the more elaborate models were also capable of reproducing networks depicting interactions with higher levels of intimacy. Our results indicate the key role of interaction intimacy in organizing antagonisms, suggesting that greater interaction intimacy might be associated with greater complexity in the assembly rules shaping ecological networks.},

These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant–pollinator and 24 plant–frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant–animal mutualistic networks (65.6\%) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2\%) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant–animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.},

These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceeds in these highly diversiﬁed mutualisms among freeliving species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., phenology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure has important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.},

Network-based tools can be used to explore and visualize mycorrhizal interaction patterns: this can pave the way towards further empirical work and hypothesis testing. However, network-based tools cannot, by themselves alone, provide much insight about the ecological mechanisms driving the establishment of mycorrhizal interactions, because many mechanisms can yield a given network-level pattern. They also cannot help predicting the future dynamics of mycorrhizal communities, because modelling studies need to be conducted using parameters and rules that are relevant to the mycorrhizal symbiosis, which is not currently done. Also, drawing analogies between mycorrhizal networks and other types of networks must be made with caution, taking into account all the potential similarities, but also discrepancies, between these kinds of unrelated networks. I think that keeping the above issues in mind will be critical to keep the network-based approach viable and useful in mycorrhizal ecology.},

To this end, they have built networks for mutualistic (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal) as well as antagonistic (e.g., herbivory, parasitism) interactions. The type of interaction being represented is believed to be reflected in the structure of the network, which would differ substantially between mutualistic and antagonistic networks. Here, we put this notion to the test by attempting to determine the type of interaction represented in a network based solely on its structure. We find that, although it is easy to separate different kinds of nonecological networks, ecological networks display much structural variation, making it difficult to distinguish between mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. We therefore frame the problem as a challenge for the community of scientists interested in computational biology and machine learning. We discuss the features a good solution to this problem should possess and the obstacles that need to be overcome to achieve this goal.},

It has been suggested that this architecture presents unique features for each type of ecological interaction: e.g., nested and modular architectures would correspond to mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, respectively. Recently, Michalska-Smith and Allesina (2019) proposed a computational challenge to test whether it is indeed possible to differentiate ecological interactions based on network architecture. Contrary to the expectation, they found that this differentiation is practically impossible, moving the question to why it is not possible to differentiate ecological interactions based on their network architecture alone. Here, we show that this differentiation becomes possible by adding the local environmental information where the networks were sampled. We show that this can be explained by the fact that environmental conditions are a confounder of ecological interactions and network architecture. That is, the lack of association between network architecture and type of ecological interactions changes by conditioning on the local environmental conditions. Additionally, we find that environmental conditions are linked to the stability of ecological networks, but the direction of this effect depends on the type of interaction network. This suggests that the association between ecological interactions and network architectures exists, but cannot be fully understood without attention to the environmental conditions acting upon them.},

These interactions often form and dissolve rapidly, but this temporal variation is not well integrated into our understanding of the causes and consequences of network structure. If interspecific interactions exhibit temporal flexibility across time periods over which organisms co-occur, then the emergent structure of the corresponding network may also be flexible, something that a temporally-static perspective will miss. Here, we use an empirical plant–pollinator system to examine short-term (week-toweek) flexibility in network structure (connectance, nestedness, and specialization) and in individual species interactions that contribute to that structure across three summer growing seasons in a subalpine ecosystem. We then compared the properties of weekly networks to the properties of cumulative networks that aggregate field observations over each full summer season. As a test of the potential robustness of networks to perturbation, we also simulated the random loss of species from weekly networks. A weekto-week view reveals considerable flexibility in the interactions of individual species and their contributions to network structure. For example, species that would be considered relatively generalized across their entire activity period may be much more specialized at certain times, and at no point as generalized as the cumulative network may suggest. Furthermore, a week-to-week view reveals corresponding flexibility in network structure and potential robustness throughout each summer growing season. We conclude that short-term flexibility in species interactions leads to short-term variation in network properties, and that a cumulative, season-long perspective may miss important aspects of the way in which species interact, with implications for understanding their ecology, evolution and conservation.},

To ﬁll this gap, we collected ants foraging on plants with extraﬂoral nectaries in 10 sites within the Brazilian Amazon to evaluate if the generality, vulnerability, nestedness, and modularity observed in these ant-plant networks could be aﬀected by changes in data categories. Speciﬁcally, we used three matrices built by diﬀerent data categories: (i) binary data (i.e., presence or absence of an interaction between a plant and an ant species); (ii) frequency data (i.e., number of times in which a plant species interacted with an ant species); and (iii) abundance data (i.e., number of workers of an ant species recorded foraging on a plant species). In general, when analyzing diﬀerent matrix categories, we observed changes in the structural organization of the studied ant-plant interaction networks. Surprisingly, however, at the species level, both categories of weighted data (i.e., frequency and abundance data) seem to be equally appropriate for describing the role of ant species. Our results highlight the need to expand the discussion about data categories in ecological interaction studies to understand how diﬀerent data categories may lead to diﬀerent ecological interpretations.},

	abstract = {Interactions among species drive the ecological and evolutionary processes in ecological communities. These interactions are effectively key components of biodiversity. Studies that use a network approach to study the structure and dynamics of communities of interacting species have revealed many patterns and associated processes. Historically these studies were restricted to trophic interactions, although network approaches are now used to study a wide range of interactions, including for example the reproductive mutualisms. However, each interaction type remains studied largely in isolation from others. Merging the various interaction types within a single integrative framework is necessary if we want to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities. Dividing the networks up is a methodological convenience as in the ﬁeld the networks occur together in space and time and will be linked by shared species. Herein, we outline a conceptual framework for studying networks composed of more than one type of interaction, highlighting key questions and research areas that would beneﬁt from their study.},

	abstract = {Species distribution patterns within naturally fragmented habitat have been found to often exhibit patterns of pronounced nestedness. Highly predictable extinction sequences are implied by these nested species distribution patterns, thus the patterns are important to both the philosophy and practice of conservation biology. A simple thermodynamic measure of the order and disorder apparent in the nested patterns is described. The metric offers (i) a measure of the uncertainty in species extinction order, (ii) a measure of relative populational stabilities, (iii) a means of identifying minimally sustainable population sizes, and (iv) an estimate of the historical coherence of the species assemblage. Four presumptions govern the development of the metric and its theory: (i) the fragmented habitat was once whole and originally populated by a single common source biota, (ii)the islands were initially uniform in their habitat heterogeneity and type mix, and have remained so throughout their post-fragmentation history, (iii) no significant clinal (latitudinal) gradation exists across the archipelago so as to promote species turnover across the archipelago, and (iv) all species of interest are equally isolated on all islands. The violation of these conditions promotes species distributions which are idiosyncratic to the general extinction order expected in fragmentation archipelagos. While some random variation in extinction order is to be expected, idiosyncratic distributional patterns differ from randomness and are readily segregatable from such noise. A method of identifying idiosyncratic species and sites is described.},

	abstract = {Mutualistic networks are crucial to the maintenance of ecosystem services. Unfortunately, what we know about seed dispersal networks is based only on bird-fruit interactions. Therefore, we aimed at filling part of this gap by investigating bat-fruit networks. It is known from population studies that: (i) some bat species depend more on fruits than others, and (ii) that some specialized frugivorous bats prefer particular plant genera. We tested whether those preferences affected the structure and robustness of the whole network and the functional roles of species. Nine bat-fruit datasets from the literature were analyzed and all networks showed lower complementary specialization (H2’ = 0.3760.10, mean 6 SD) and similar nestedness (NODF = 0.5660.12) than pollination networks. All networks were modular (M = 0.3260.07), and had on average four cohesive subgroups (modules) of tightly connected bats and plants. The composition of those modules followed the genus-genus associations observed at population level (Artibeus-Ficus, Carollia-Piper, and Sturnira-Solanum), although a few of those plant genera were dispersed also by other bats. Bat-fruit networks showed high robustness to simulated cumulative removals of both bats (R = 0.5560.10) and plants (R = 0.6860.09). Primary frugivores interacted with a larger proportion of the plants available and also occupied more central positions; furthermore, their extinction caused larger changes in network structure. We conclude that bat-fruit networks are highly cohesive and robust mutualistic systems, in which redundancy is high within modules, although modules are complementary to each other. Dietary specialization seems to be an important structuring factor that affects the topology, the guild structure and functional roles in bat-fruit networks.},

Simple ecological and evolutionary factors have been hypothesized to lead to nested networks. Therefore, nestedness is expected to occur in other types of mutualisms as well. We tested the above prediction with the network structure of interactions in cleaning symbiosis at three reef assemblages. In this type of interaction, shrimps and fishes forage on ectoparasites and injured tissues from the body surface of fish species. Cleaning networks show strong patterns of nestedness. In fact, after controlling for species richness, cleaning networks are even more nested than plant–animal mutualisms. Our results support the notion that mutualisms evolve to a predictable community-level structure, be it in terrestrial or marine communities.},

	abstract = {High variability in plant-growth response to the presence of different mycorrhizal fungi can be a major determinant of local plant species diversity. Multiple species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can coexist in terrestrial ecosystems, and co-occurring plants can differ in their response to colonization by these different fungi. However, the range of mycorrhizal plant-growth responses that can occur within communities has not been determined. In the present study, I crossed a large number of plant and fungal species that co-occur to determine the range of responses that can exist within an ecosystem. I also crossed exotic fungal isolates vs. local plant isolates and local fungal isolates vs. exotic plant isolates to determine whether the range of plant growth responses differs when using foreign genotypes. The data indicate that plant growth responses to mycorrhizal inoculation within an ecosystem can range from highly parasitic to highly mutualistic. In this study, the direction and magnitude of the response depended on the combination of plant and fungal species. No plant did best with the same fungal isolate. The range of responses was greatest when using local plants and fungi. Whereas parasitic and mutualistic responses were also detected when using foreign plant or fungal genotypes, the range of responses was signiﬁcantly reduced, as was the relative frequency of positive responses. Overall, this study suggests that, within ecosystems, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can function along a continuum from parasitism to mutualism, and that extreme responses are more common when using locally adapted plants and fungi. This high variation in plant growth response may be a large contributor to plant species coexistence and the structure of plant communities.},

Different metrics are used to assess the stability of ecological systems, and the choice of one metric over another may result in conflicting conclusions. Although each of the multitude of metrics is useful for answering a specific question about stability, the relationship among metrics is poorly understood. Such lack of understanding prevents scientists from developing a unified concept of stability. Instead, by investigating these relationships we can unveil how many dimensions of stability there are (i.e., in how many independent components stability metrics can be grouped), which should help build a more comprehensive concept of stability. Here we simultaneously measured 27 stability metrics frequently used in ecological studies. Our approach is based on dynamical simulations of multispecies trophic communities under different perturbation scenarios. Mapping the relationships between the metrics revealed that they can be lumped into 3 main groups of relatively independent stability components: early response to pulse, sensitivities to press, and distance to threshold. Selecting metrics from each of these groups allows a more accurate and comprehensive quantification of the overall stability of ecological communities. These results contribute to improving our understanding and assessment of stability in ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Whether interactions between species are conserved on evolutionary time-scales is a central question in ecology and evolution. It has spurred the development of both correlative and model-based approaches for testing phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions: do closely related species interact with similar sets of partners? Here we test the statistical performances of some of these approaches using simulations. We find that one of the most widely used model-based approach, the Phylogenetic Bipartite Linear Model (PBLM), often detects phylogenetic signal when it should not. Simple Mantel tests investigating the correlation between phylogenetic distances and dissimilarities in sets of interacting partners instead have low type-I error rates and satisfactory statistical power, especially when using weighted interactions and phylogenetic dissimilarity metrics; however, they often artifactually detect anti-phylogenetic signals. Partial Mantel tests, which are used to partial out the phylogenetic signal in the number of partners, actually fail at correcting for this confounding effect, and we instead propose the sequential use of simple Mantel tests. We also explore the ability of simple Mantel tests to analyze clade-specific phylogenetic signal, while current methods only measure an overall signal. We provide general guidelines and an empirical application on an interaction network between orchids and mycorrhizal fungi.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, most studies focus on one interaction type at a time, leaving community ecologists unsure of how positive and negative associations among species combine to influence biodiversity patterns. Using surveys of plant populations in alpine communities worldwide, we explore patterns of positive and negative associations among triads of species (modules) and their relationship to local biodiversity. Three modules, each incorporating both positive and negative associations, were overrepresented, thus acting as "network motifs." Furthermore, the overrepresentation of these network motifs is positively linked to species diversity globally. A theoretical model illustrates that these network motifs, based on competition between facilitated species or facilitation between inferior competitors, increase local persistence. Our findings suggest that the interplay of competition and facilitation is crucial for maintaining biodiversity.},

The role of species interactions in propagating the effects of stressors, although widely acknowledged, has yet to be formally explored. Here, we conceptualise how stressors propagate through food webs and explore how they affect simulated three-­species motifs and food webs of the Canadian St. Lawrence System. We find that overlooking species interactions invariably underestimate the effects of stressors, and that synergistic and antagonistic effects through food webs are prevalent. We also find that interaction type influences a species’ susceptibility to stressors; species in omnivory and tri-­trophic food chain interactions in particular are sensitive and prone to synergistic and antagonistic effects. Finally, we find that apex predators were negatively affected and mesopredators benefited from the effects of stressors due to their trophic position in the St. Lawrence System, but that species sensitivity is dependent on food web structure. In conceptualising the effects of multiple stressors on food webs, we bring theory closer to practice and show that considering the intricacies of ecological communities is key to assess the net effects of stressors on species.},

Standard resource-competition models from this theory predict that the number of coexisting species should not exceed the number of factors that limit population growth. Here I show that positive interactions among resource competitors can produce species-rich model communities supported by a single limiting resource. Simulations show that when resource competitors reduce each othersÕ per capita mortality rate (e.g. by ameliorating an abiotic stress), stable multispecies coexistence with a single resource may be common, even while the net interspeciﬁc interaction remains negative. These results demonstrate that positive interactions may provide an important mechanism for generating species-rich communities in nature. They also show that focusing on the net interaction between species may conceal important coexistence mechanisms when species simultaneously engage in both antagonistic and positive interactions.},

In contrast, little is known in terrestrial ecosystems, where there is evidence that herbivores can also impact ecosystem stoichiometry. I studied a stoichiometric model of the soil-­plant-­herbivore system. The model shows that herbivores influence the ecosystem stoichiometry mainly through the direct and indirect controls of ecosystem inputs and losses, in a more complex way than predicted by the classic consumer-­driven recycling theory. Overall, it shows that herbivores affect nutrient ratios in terrestrial ecosystems mostly independently of their own stoichiometric ratios, and that their impact may be different in forest versus grassland. The results highlight the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystems to elusive actors, negligible in biomass but capable of modifying nutrient loss rates with major impacts on nutrient cycles and ecosystem stoichiometry.},

Our model shows that, while alpha diversity decreases local ecosystem variability, beta diversity generally contributes to increasing spatial asynchrony among local ecosystems. Consequently, both alpha and beta diversity provide stabilising effects for regional ecosystems, through local and spatial insurance effects respectively. We further show that at the regional scale, the stabilising effect of biodiversity increases as spatial environmental correlation increases.

We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales.

Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity–stability relationships. We ﬁrst explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspeciﬁc competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species’ intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species’ intrinsic responses to environmental ﬂuctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The ﬁrst two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity–stability debate to a ﬁnal resolution.},

            Mutualistic networks are vital ecological and social systems shaped by adaptation and evolution. They involve bipartite cooperation via the exchange of goods or services between actors of different types. Empirical observations of mutualistic networks across genres and geographic conditions reveal correlated nested and modular patterns. Yet, the underlying mechanism for the network assembly remains unclear. We propose a niche-based adaptive mechanism where both nestedness and modularity emerge simultaneously as complementary facets of an optimal niche structure. Key dynamical properties are revealed at different timescales. Foremost, mutualism can either enhance or reduce the network stability, depending on competition intensity. Moreover, structural adaptations are asymmetric, exhibiting strong hysteresis in response to environmental change. Finally, at the evolutionary timescale we show that the adaptive mechanism plays a crucial role in preserving the distinctive patterns of mutualism under species invasions and extinctions.},

	abstract = {Understanding food-web persistence is an important long-term objective of ecology because of its relevance in maintaining biodiversity. To date, many dynamic studies of food-web behaviour—both empirical and theoretical—have focused on smaller subwebs, called trophic modules, because these modules are more tractable experimentally and analytically than whole food webs. The question remains to what degree studies of trophic modules are relevant to infer the persistence of entire food webs. Four trophic modules have received particular attention in the literature: tri-trophic food chains, omnivory, exploitative competition, and apparent competition. Here, we integrate analysis of these modulesÕ dynamics in isolation with those of whole food webs to directly assess the appropriateness of scaling from modules to food webs. We ﬁnd that there is not a direct, one-to-one, relationship between the relative persistence of modules in isolation and their effect on persistence of an entire food web. Nevertheless, we observe that those modules which are most commonly found in empirical food webs are those that confer the greatest community persistence. As a consequence, we demonstrate that there may be signiﬁcant dynamic justiﬁcations for empirically-observed food-web structure.},

Other such types include habitat modiﬁcation, predator interference and facilitation. However, ecological network research has been typically limited to either pure food webs or to networks of only a few ({\textless}3) interaction types. The great diversity of non-trophic interactions observed in nature has been poorly addressed by ecologists and largely excluded from network theory. Herein, we propose a conceptual framework that organises this diversity into three main functional classes deﬁned by how they modify speciﬁc parameters in a dynamic food web model.

We present the ﬁrst effort, to our knowledge, describing a comprehensive ecological network that includes all known trophic and diverse non-trophic links among .100 coexisting species for the marine rocky intertidal community of the central Chilean coast. Our results suggest that non-trophic interactions exhibit highly nonrandom structures both alone and with respect to food web structure. The occurrence of different types of interactions, relative to all possible links, was well predicted by trophic structure and simple traits of the source and target species. In this community, competition for space and positive interactions related to habitat/refuge provisioning by sessile and/or basal species were by far the most abundant non-trophic interactions. If these patterns are corroborated in other ecosystems, they may suggest potentially important dynamic constraints on the combined architecture of trophic and non-trophic interactions.

This complex spectrum of interactions constitutes a network of links that mediates ecological communities’ response to perturbations, such as exploitation and climate change. In the last decades, there have been great advances in the study of intricate ecological networks. We have, nonetheless, lacked both the data and the tools to more rigorously understand the patterning of multiple interaction types between species (i.e., “multiplex networks”), as well as their consequences for community dynamics. Using network statistical modeling applied to a comprehensive ecological network, which includes trophic and diverse non-trophic links, we provide a first glimpse at what the full “entangled bank” of species looks like. The community exhibits clear multidimensional structure, which is taxonomically coherent and broadly predictable from species traits. Moreover, dynamic simulations suggest that this non-random patterning of how diverse non-trophic interactions map onto the food web could allow for higher species persistence and higher total biomass than expected by chance and tends to promote a higher robustness to extinctions.},

The role of species interactions in propagating the effects of stressors, although widely acknowledged, has yet to be formally explored. Here, we conceptualise how stressors propagate through food webs and explore how they affect simulated three-­species motifs and food webs of the Canadian St. Lawrence System. We find that overlooking species interactions invariably underestimate the effects of stressors, and that synergistic and antagonistic effects through food webs are prevalent. We also find that interaction type influences a species’ susceptibility to stressors; species in omnivory and tri-­trophic food chain interactions in particular are sensitive and prone to synergistic and antagonistic effects. Finally, we find that apex predators were negatively affected and mesopredators benefited from the effects of stressors due to their trophic position in the St. Lawrence System, but that species sensitivity is dependent on food web structure. In conceptualising the effects of multiple stressors on food webs, we bring theory closer to practice and show that considering the intricacies of ecological communities is key to assess the net effects of stressors on species.},

We found positive intraspeciﬁc feedbacks between mussels and their recruits, and negative interspeciﬁc feedbacks between mussels and their associated ecosystem. These feedbacks were associated with mussel bed ecosystem processes (ﬂuxes of ammonium and oxygen). In addition, we showed that proximity between mussel patches increased within-patch nutrient ﬂuxes. Our study revealed the potential for meta-ecosystem engineering to drive feedback interactions between community and ecosystem functioning in marine fragmented systems.

We argue that consumers link food webs in space and that this spatial structure combined with relatively rapid behavioural responses by consumers can strongly inﬂuence the dynamics of food webs. Employing simple spatially implicit food web models, we show that large mobile consumers are inordinately important in determining the stability, or lack of it, in ecosystems. More speciﬁcally, this theory suggests that mobile higher order organisms are potent stabilizers when embedded in a variable, and expansive spatial structure. However, when space is compressed and higher order consumers strongly couple local habitats then mobile consumers can have an inordinate destabilizing effect.

We parameterise StDMs for a consumer-resource (moose-white birch) system and demonstrate that we can develop predictive models of resource stoichiometry across a landscape and that such models could improve our predictions of consumer space use. With results from our study system application, we argue that explicit consideration of the spatial patterns in organismal elemental composition may uncover emergent individual, population, community and ecosystem properties that are not revealed at the local extents routinely used in ecological stoichiometry. We discuss perspectives for further developments and application of StDMs to advance three emerging frameworks for spatial ecosystem ecology in an era of global change; meta-ecosystem theory, macroecological stoichiometry and remotely sensed biogeochemistry. Progress on these emerging frameworks will allow for the integration of ecological stoichiometry and individual space use and ﬁtness.},

	abstract = {Almost 50 years ago, Michael Rosenzweig pointed out that nutrient addition can destabilise food webs, leading to loss of species and reduced ecosystem function through the paradox of enrichment. Around the same time, David Tilman demonstrated that increased nutrient loading would also be expected to cause competitive exclusion leading to deleterious changes in food web diversity. While both concepts have greatly illuminated general diversity-stability theory, we currently lack a coherent framework to predict how nutrients inﬂuence food web stability across a landscape. This is a vitally important gap in our understanding, given mounting evidence of serious ecological disruption arising from anthropogenic displacement of resources and organisms. Here, we combine contemporary theory on food webs and meta-ecosystems to show that nutrient additions are indeed expected to drive loss in stability and function in human-impacted regions. Our models suggest that destabilisation is more likely to be caused by the complete loss of an equilibrium due to edible plant species being competitively excluded. In highly modiﬁed landscapes, spatial nutrient transport theory suggests that such instabilities can be ampliﬁed over vast distances from the sites of nutrient addition. Consistent with this theoretical synthesis, the empirical frequency of these distant propagating ecosystem imbalances appears to be growing. This synthesis of theory and empirical data suggests that human modiﬁcation of the Earth is strongly connecting distantly separated ecosystems, causing rapid, expansive and costly nutrient-driven instabilities over vast areas of the planet. Similar to existing food web theory, the corollary to this spatial nutrient theory is that slowing down spatial nutrient pathways can be a potent means of stabilising degraded ecosystems.},

Prior experimental studies showed that terrestrial prey that enter the stream from the adjacent forest caused positive indirect effects on aquatic invertebrates during summer by diverting fish consumption. Seasonal and annual estimates of secondary production and organic matter flows along food web pathways demonstrate that this seasonal input of terrestrial invertebrate prey increases production of certain fish species, reversing the indirect effect on aquatic invertebrates from positive at the seasonal timescale to negative at the annual timescale. Even though terrestrial invertebrate prey contributed 54\% of the annual organic matter flux to fishes, primarily during summer, fish still consumed 98\% of the aquatic invertebrate annual production, leading to top-down control that is not revealed in short-term experiments and demonstrating that aquatic prey may be a limiting resource for fishes. Changes in the direction or magnitude of interactions may be a key factor creating nonlinear or stabilizing feedbacks in complex systems, and these dynamics can be revealed by merging experimental and comparative approaches at different scales.},

We found large elemental imbalances between consumers and food resources compared with living plant-based systems, particularly in regard to P content, which were reduced with enrichment. Enrichment signiﬁcantly increased nutrient content of food resources (consistent with uptake of N and P by detritus-associated microbes). P content of some invertebrates also increased in the enriched vs. reference stream, suggesting deviation from strict homeostasis. Nutrient content varied signiﬁcantly among invertebrate functional feeding groups, orders and, to some extent, size classes.

	abstract = {Population dynamics theory forms the quantitative core from which most ecologists have developed their intuition about how species interactions, heterogeneity, and biodiversity play out in time. Throughout its development, theoretical population biology has built on variants of the Lotka–Volterra equations and in nearly all cases has taken a single-currency approach to understanding population change, abstracting populations as aggregations of individuals or biomass. In this review, we explore how depicting organisms as built of more than one thing (for example, C and an important nutrient, such as P) in stoichiometrically explicit models results in qualitatively different predictions about the resulting dynamics. Fundamentally, stoichiometric models incorporate both food quantity and food quality effects in a single framework, allow key feedbacks such as consumer-driven nutrient recycling to occur, and generally appear to stabilize predator–prey systems while simultaneously producing rich dynamics with alternative domains of attraction and occasionally counterintuitive outcomes, such as coexistence of more than one predator species on a single-prey item and decreased herbivore performance in response to increased light intensity experienced by the autotrophs. In addition to the theoretical background, we also review recent laboratory and ﬁeld studies considering stoichiometric effects on autotroph–herbivore systems, emphasizing algae–Daphnia interactions. These studies support the predictions of stoichiometric theory, providing empirical evidence for alternative stable states under stoichiometric constraints, for negative effects of solar radiation on herbivores via stoichiometric food quality, and for diversity-enhancing effects of poor food quality. Stoichiometric theory has strong potential for both quantitative and qualitative improvements in the predictive power of population ecology, a major priority in light of the multivariate anthropogenic and natural perturbations experienced by populations. However, full development and testing of stoichiometric population dynamics theory will require greater intellectual tolerance and exchange between researchers working in ecosystem and population ecology.},

At the community level, stoichiometric homoeostasis was also positively correlated with ecosystem function and stability in most cases. Thus, homoeostatic species tend to have high and stable biomass; and ecosystems dominated by more homoeostatic species have higher productivity and greater stability. By modulating organism responses to key environmental drivers, stoichiometric homoeostasis appears to be a major mechanism responsible for the structure, functioning and stability of grassland ecosystems.},

Most conceptual models predict that plants with high nutrient contents increase nutrient excretion by herbivores, in turn raising nutrient availability. To test this hypothesis, we built a stoichiometrically explicit model that includes a simple but thorough description of the processes of herbivory and decomposition. Our results challenge traditional views of herbivore impacts on nutrient availability in many ways. They show that the relationship between plant nutrient content and the impact of herbivores predicted by conceptual models holds only at high plant nutrient contents. At low plant nutrient contents, the impact of herbivores is mediated by the mineralization/immobilization of nutrients by decomposers and by the type of resource limiting the growth of decomposers. Both parameters are functions of the mismatch between plant and decomposer stoichiometries. Our work provides new predictions about the impacts of herbivores on ecosystem fertility that depend on critical interactions between plant, herbivore and decomposer stoichiometries in ecosystems.},

If plants have a greater affinity for phosphorus than for nitrogen, low herbivore nitrogen: phosphorus ratio can even promote nitrogen limitation.

Herein, we summarise multiple-resource limitation responses in plant communities using a dataset of 641 studies that applied factorial addition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in freshwater, marine and terrestrial systems. We found that more than half of the studies displayed some type of synergistic response to N and P addition.

The results indicated that these essential nutrients interact, and do not strictly follow LiebigÕs minimum rule, which consistently overestimates growth at co-limiting conditions and thus is not applicable to describe multiple nutrient limitation of herbivorous consumers.

	abstract = {The widespread occurrence of nitrogen limitation to net primary production in terrestrial and marine ecosystems is something of a puzzle; it would seem that nitrogen fixers should have a substantial competitive advantage wherever nitrogen is limiting, and that their activity in turn should reverse limitation. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that nitrogen limits net primary production much of the time in most terrestrial biomes and many marine ecosystems. We examine both how the biogeochemistry of the nitrogen cycle could cause limitation to develop, and how nitrogen limitation could persist as a consequence of processes that prevent or reduce nitrogen fixation. Biogeochemical mechansism that favor nitrogen limitation include: - the substantial mobility of nitrogen across ecosystem boundaries, which favors nitogen limitation in the “source” ecosystem - especially where denitrification is important in sediments and soils, or in terrestrial ecosystems where fire is frequent; - differences in the biochemistry of nitrogen as opposed to phosphorus (with detrital N mostly carbon-bonded and detrital P mostly ester-bonded), which favor the development of nitrogen limitation where decomposition is slow, and allow the development of a positive feedback from nitrogen limitation to producers, to reduced decomposition of their detritus, and on to reduced nitrogen availability; and - other more specialized, but perhaps no less important, processes. A number of mechanisms could keep nitrogen fixation from reversing nitrogen limitation. These include: - energetic constraints on the colonization or activity of nitrogen fixers; - limitation of nitrogen fixers or fixation by another nutrient (phosphorus, molybdenum, or iron) - which would then represent the ultimate factor limiting net primary production; - other physical and ecological mechanisms. The possible importance of these and other processes is discussed for a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.},

This fundamental ecosystem attribute has long been recognized but the inﬂuence of this property on community regulation has not been investigated. We propose that this environmental attribute may explain variation in the strength of trophic cascades among ecosystems. Simply because of gravity, we should predict that systems with convex proﬁles receive low amounts of subsidies whereas systems with concave proﬁles act as spatial attractors, and receive high amounts of subsidies. The subsidy hypothesis states that ecosystems with high amounts of allochthonous inputs will experience the strongest trophic cascades. To test this hypothesis, we derive ecosystem models and investigate the effect of location and magnitude of subsidies on the strength of trophic cascades. Predictions from our models support the subsidy hypothesis and highlight the need to consider ecosystems as open to allochthonous ﬂows.},

Considering quantity and quality together may provide a simple, but previously unexplored, framework for identifying the mechanisms that govern the importance of subsidies for recipient food webs and ecosystems. Using a literature review of .90 studies of open-water metabolism in lakes and streams, we show that high-ﬂux, low-quality subsidies can drive freshwater ecosystem dynamics. Because most of these ecosystems are net heterotrophic, allochthonous inputs must subsidize respiration. Second, using a literature review of subsidy quality and use, we demonstrate that animals select for high-quality food resources in proportions greater than would be predicted based on food quantity, and regardless of allochthonous or autochthonous origin. This ﬁnding suggests that low-ﬂux, high-quality subsidies may be selected for by animals, and in turn may disproportionately affect food web and ecosystem processes (e.g., animal production, trophic energy or organic matter ﬂow, trophic cascades). We then synthesize and review approaches that evaluate the role of subsidies and explicitly merge ecosystem and food web perspectives by placing food web measurements in the context of ecosystem budgets, by comparing trophic and ecosystem production and ﬂuxes, and by constructing ﬂow food webs. These tools can and should be used to address future questions about subsidies, such as the relative importance of subsidies to different trophic levels and how subsidies may maintain or disrupt ecosystem stability and food web interactions.},

Based on competition and stoichiometry theories the carbon hypothesis states that, since bacteria are better competitors for nutrients, they may drive themselves to carbon (C)-limitation, so coexistence would naturally arise between nutrient-limited algae and C-limited bacteria. We tested the carbon hypothesis in 24 closed aquatic microcosms with 4 different artificial media inoculated with an alga (Scenedesmus obliquus) and a natural bacterial community. We monitored algal and bacterial growth, coexistence over time, and the limitation status of S. obliquus and the bacterial community. In all 24 microcosms, both the algal and the bacterial communities showed a net growth phase followed by a plateau, reflecting stable coexistence over time. At the plateau, the algae were limited by nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P), depending on the medium, whereas the bacteria were co-limited by organic C and the nutrients N and P. We argue that these results are consistent with the carbon hypothesis, and we discuss the fact that bacteria were co-limited instead of purely C-limited in light of the resource-ratio theory. Our results provide evidence that, even in the absence of factors preventing competitive exclusion (e.g. spatial heterogeneity, temporal fluctuations, predators), phytoplankton and bacteria can coexist and sustain basic ecosystem functions, namely primary production and nutrient cycling.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of studies in a wide range of natural systems have investigated how pulses of resource availability inﬂuence ecological processes at individual, population, and community levels. Taken together, these studies suggest that some common processes may underlie pulsed resource dynamics in a wide diversity of systems. Developing a common framework of terms and concepts for the study of resource pulses may facilitate greater synthesis among these apparently disparate systems. Here, we propose a general deﬁnition of the resource pulse concept, outline some common patterns in the causes and consequences of resource pulses, and suggest a few key questions for future investigations. We deﬁne resource pulses as episodes of increased resource availability in space and time that combine low frequency (rarity), large magnitude (intensity), and short duration (brevity), and emphasize the importance of considering resource pulses at spatial and temporal scales relevant to speciﬁc resource–consumer interactions. Although resource pulses are uncommon events for consumers in speciﬁc systems, our review of the existing literature suggests that pulsed resource dynamics are actually widespread phenomena in nature. Resource pulses often result from climatic and environmental factors, processes of spatiotemporal accumulation and release, outbreak population dynamics, or a combination of these factors. These events can affect life history traits and behavior at the level of individual consumers, numerical responses at the population level, and indirect effects at the community level. Consumers show strategies for utilizing ephemeral resources opportunistically, reducing resource variability by averaging over larger spatial scales, and tolerating extended interpulse periods of reduced resource availability. Resource pulses can also create persistent effects in communities through several mechanisms. We suggest that the study of resource pulses provides opportunities to understand the dynamics of many speciﬁc systems, and may also contribute to broader ecological questions at individual, population, and community levels.},

However, aquatic and terrestrial ecologists have mainly studied these ecosystems separately, a “splendid isolation” historically fostered by disciplinary boundaries between institutes and funding schemes. Here, we synthesize the progress made in joint aquatic and terrestrial research and suggest new approaches to meeting future research challenges in changing environments. Aquatic and terrestrial organisms use cross-system subsidies to a comparable extent and addressing reciprocal subsidies is therefore necessary in order to understand biodiversity and functioning of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We suggest that the metaecosystem framework could be expanded to explicitly consider cross-system fluxes of matter differing in magnitude and quality. We further advocate the inclusion of cross-system analyses at broader spatial extents, for which remote-sensing applications would be a useful tool in environmental research at the land–water interface. A cross-ecosystem approach would therefore be valuable for a more thorough understanding of ecosystem responses to various stressors in the face of rapid environmental change.},

              Connochaetes taurinus
              ) through the Serengeti Mara Ecosystem is the largest remaining overland migration in the world. One of the most iconic portions of their migration is crossing of the Mara River, during which thousands drown annually. These mass drownings have been noted, but their frequency, size, and impact on aquatic ecosystems have not been quantified. Here, we estimate the frequency and size of mass drownings in the Mara River and model the fate of carcass nutrients through the river ecosystem. Mass drownings ({\textgreater}100 individuals) occurred in at least 13 of the past 15 y; on average, 6,250 carcasses and 1,100 tons of biomass enter the river each year. Half of a wildebeest carcass dry mass is bone, which takes 7 y to decompose, thus acting as a long-term source of nutrients to the Mara River. Carcass soft tissue decomposes in 2–10 wk, and these nutrients are mineralized by consumers, assimilated by biofilms, transported downstream, or moved back into the terrestrial ecosystem by scavengers. These inputs comprise 34–50\% of the assimilated diet of fish when carcasses are present and 7–24\% via biofilm on bones after soft tissue decomposition. Our results show a terrestrial animal migration can have large impacts on a river ecosystem, which may influence nutrient cycling and river food webs at decadal time scales. Similar mass drownings may have played an important role in rivers throughout the world when large migratory herds were more common features of the landscape.},

Theoretical models suggest short-term responses to a single pulse can qualitatively differ from longer-term responses. Recurrent resource pulses can alter community structure, permitting coexistence that otherwise would not occur, or hamper coexistence mechanisms effective in stable environments. For a given resource input, system responses can be more dramatic with short pulses. Resource pulses can cause transitions between alternative states. Dispersal permits species to exploit locally sporadic resource pulses and persist in environments that on average are unsuitable. All these issues are ripe for further theoretical explorations.},

The passive ﬂows of energy such as leaf litter and terrestrial invertebrate inputs, as well as dissolved organic carbon, are donor-controlled, whereas other ﬂows, such as between ﬁsh and ﬁsh-eating birds, have more directly coupled feedbacks. There are also ﬂows upstream or to the terrestrial environment in the form of adult aquatic insects, salmon carcasses and particulate carbon through overbank ﬂooding, as well as directed foraging activities. Hypotheses about the effects of ﬂux rates, timing, quality and physical structure of such resource subsidies on the responses of consumers have been experimentally tested at many trophic levels. Many freshwater and terrestrial consumers depend on these subsidies for at least part of their life cycle, and timing of inputs can affect growth. Developing more quantitative relations between the population and community responses across gradients of cross-ecosystem resource subsidy input rates will require exploring the shape of the relations, as well as the effects of quality and timing on responses. The stage is now set to consider how resource subsidies might affect the stability of communities and processes such as the strength of trophic cascades. The high degree of connectivity between the land and water are essential to biodiversity conservation and to ensuring that critical aquatic ecosystem services are sustained. The management of riparian areas is a key to the security of these values. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Nutrient and detrital subsidies usually increase primary and secondary productivity, both directly and indirectly. Prey subsidies, by movement of either prey or predators, usually enhance predator abundance beyond what local resources can support. Top-down effects occur when spatially subsidized consumers affect local resources by suppressing key resources and occasionally by initiating trophic cascades. Effects on community dynamics vary with the relative amount of input, the trophic roles of the mobile and recipient entities, and the local food web structure.

	abstract = {Classical approaches to food webs focus on patterns and processes occurring at the community level rather than at the broader ecosystem scale, and often ignore spatial aspects of the dynamics. However, recent research suggests that spatial processes inﬂuence both food web and ecosystem dynamics, and has led to the idea of ÔmetaecosystemsÕ. However, these processes have been tackled separately by Ôfood web metacommunityÕ ecology, which focuses on the movement of traits, and Ôlandscape ecosystemÕ ecology, which focuses on the movement of materials among ecosystems. Here, we argue that this conceptual gap must be bridged to fully understand ecosystem dynamics because many natural cases demonstrate the existence of interactions between the movements of traits and materials.

However, current metacommunity theory largely ignores how the ﬂows of limiting nutrients across ecosystems can inﬂuence communities. We studied a meta-ecosystem model where two autotroph–consumer communities are spatially coupled through the diffusion of the limiting nutrient. We analyzed regional and local stability, as well as spatial and temporal synchrony to elucidate the impacts of nutrient recycling and diffusion on trophic dynamics. We show that nutrient diffusion is capable of inducing asynchronous local destabilization of biotic compartments through a diffusion-induced spatiotemporal bifurcation. Nutrient recycling interacts with nutrient diffusion and inﬂuences the susceptibility of the meta-ecosystem to diffusion-induced instabilities. This interaction between nutrient recycling and transport is further shown to depend on ecosystem enrichment. It more generally emphasizes the importance of meta-ecosystem theory for predicting species persistence and distribution in managed ecosystems.},

Spider density is negatively correlated with island size; many small islands support 50-200 spiders per m3 of cactus. Energy for these spiders comes primarily from the ocean and not from in situ productivity by land plants. We explicitly connect the marine and terrestrial systems to show that insular food webs represent one endpoint of the marine web. We describe two conduits for marine energy entering these islands: shore drift and seabird colonies. Both conduits are related to island area, having a much stronger effect on smaller islands. This asymmetric effect helps to explain the exceptionally high spider densities on small islands. Although productivity sets the maximal potential densities, predation (by scorpions) limits realized spider abundance. Thus, prey availability and predation act in concert to set insular spider abundance.},

The models built to mimic these responses have invoked local mechanisms at the level of the primary producers. In this paper, we explore an alternative explanation for the emergence of co-limitation by developing a simple, stoichiometrically explicit meta-ecosystem model with two limiting nutrients, autotrophs and herbivores. Our results show that differences in movement rates for the nutrients, autotrophs and herbivores can allow for nutrient co-limitation in biomass response to emerge despite no local mechanisms of nutrient co-limitation. Furthermore, our results provide an explanation to why autotrophs show positive growth responses to nutrients despite ‘nominal’ top-down control by herbivores. These results suggest that spatial processes can be mechanisms for nutrient co-limitation at local and regional scales, and can help explain anomalous results in the co-limitation literature.},

We present a model meta-ecosystem with finite and irregular spatial structure consisting of local nutrient–autotrophs–herbivores ecosystems connected through spatial flows of materials and organisms. We study the effect of spatial flows on stability and ecosystem functions, and provide simple metrics of connectivity that can predict these effects. Our results show that high rates of nutrient and herbivore movement can destabilize local ecosystem dynamics, leading to spatially heterogeneous equilibria or oscillations across the meta-ecosystem, with generally increased meta-ecosystem primary and secondary production. However, the onset and the spatial scale of these emergent dynamics depend heavily on the spatial structure of the meta-ecosystem and on the relative movement rate of the autotrophs. We show how this strong dependence on finite spatial structure eludes commonly used metrics of connectivity, but can be predicted by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix that describe the spatial structure and scale.

Despite mounting evidence that communities’ dynamics can be indirectly coupled by reciprocal among ecosystem resource flows, our understanding of how directional resource flows might indirectly link biological communities is limited. We here propose that differences in community structure upstream should lead to different downstream dynamics, even in the absence of dispersal of organisms. We report an experimental test of the effect of upstream community structure on downstream community dynamics in a simplified but highly controlled setting, using protist microcosms. We implemented directional flows of resources, without dispersal, from a standard resource pool into upstream communities of contrasting interaction structure and then to further downstream communities of either one or two trophic levels. Our results demonstrate that different types of species interactions in upstream habitats may lead to different population sizes and levels of biomass in these upstream habitats. This, in turn, leads to varying levels of detritus transfer (dead biomass) to the downstream communities, thus influencing their population densities and trophic interactions in predictable ways. Our results suggest that the structure of species interactions in directionally structured ecosystems can be a key mediator of alterations to downstream habitats. Alterations to upstream habitats can thus cascade down to downstream communities, even without dispersal.},

The literature on tipping points has grown rapidly, but almost exclusively based on aquatic and aboveground systems. So far little effort has been made to make links to soil systems, where change is not as drastically apparent, timescales may differ and recovery may be slower. Predicting belowground ecosystem state transitions and recovery, and their impacts on aboveground systems, remains a major scientiﬁc, practical and policy challenge. Recently observed major changes in aboveground tree condition across European forests are probably causally linked to ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal changes belowground. Based on recent breakthroughs in data collection and analysis, we apply tipping point theory to forests, including their belowground component, focusing on EM fungi; link environmental thresholds for EM fungi with nutrient imbalances in forest trees; explore the role of phenotypic plasticity in EM fungal adaptation to, and recovery from, environmental change; and propose major positive feedback mechanisms to understand, address and predict forest ecosystem tipping points.},

	abstract = {Fluxes of resource subsidies, such as terrestrial leaf litter to streams and adult aquatic insects to riparian predators, are examples of important links between adjacent ecosystems. The importance of these cross-ecosystem resource ﬂows from donor systems to recipient consumers is increasingly recognized. Streams, especially small streams with their high edge ratio with the terrestrial system, provide excellent models for the study of subsidies and a large portion of this literature has been produced by aquatic scientists. Field experiments manipulating ﬂows between small streams and their riparian areas (e.g. leaf litter, terrestrial invertebrates, and adult aquatic insects to riparian areas) have indicated that consumers in streams and riparian areas are highly dependent upon such subsidies and the value of the subsidies are further modiﬁed by patterns of retention and pathways of use. Experiments typically indicate rapid growth or demographic responses by consumers, indicating these populations are resource limited or at levels of incipient population limitation, and can capitalize on short-term resource pulses. More press manipulations are still necessary to determine the dynamical consequences of subsidies for recipient communities. The nature of the subsidy (e.g. species of litter or invertebrates) and its timing are also important details that need further study. Finally, there are opportunities to consider the evolution of life cycle timing (modelling), interception strategies by recipient populations and short-term and long-term responses of communities.

We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial ﬂows of materials such as inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial ﬂows of an inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient ﬂow) and organic matter (indirect nutrient ﬂow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can reverse the source–sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the balance between such direct and indirect nutrient ﬂows determines the net direction of nutrient ﬂows between two ecosystems of contrasted productivities. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This effect of nutrient ﬂows on source and sink dynamics is robust to the ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to speciﬁc ecosystem compartments contributing to nutrient ﬂows (primary producers, herbivores, or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with the structure at one place inﬂuencing that of the other. In metaecosystems, the source–sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its dispersal from the source to the sink, but also by the fertility and community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial ﬂows of nutrients and energy. The meta-ecosystem perspective provides a powerful theoretical framework to address novel questions in spatial ecosystem ecology.},

Yet local recycling of materials from enriched ecosystems may affect the stability of connected ecosystems. Here we study the effect of nutrient, detritus, producer, and consumer spatial ﬂows—combined with changes in regional enrichment—on the stability of a metaecosystem model. We considered both spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous enrichment. We found that nutrient and detritus spatial ﬂows are destabilizing, whereas producer or consumer spatial ﬂows are either neutral or stabilizing. We noticed that detritus spatial ﬂows have only a weak impact on stability. Our study reveals that heterogeneity no longer stabilizes well-connected systems when accounting for explicit representation of nutrient dynamics. We also found that intermediate consumer diffusion could lead to multiple equilibria in strongly enriched metaecosystems. Stability can emerge from a top-down control allowing the storage of materials into inorganic form, a mechanism never documented before. In conclusion, local enrichment can be stabilized if spatial ﬂows are strong enough to efﬁciently redistribute the local excess of enrichment to unfertile ecosystems. However, high regional enrichment can be dampened only by intermediate consumer diffusion rates.},

	abstract = {Cross-ecosystem movements of material and energy, particularly reciprocal resource fluxes across the freshwater-land interface, have received major attention. Freshwater ecosystems may receive higher amounts of subsidies (i.e., resources produced outside the focal ecosystem) than terrestrial ecosystems, potentially leading to increased secondary production in freshwaters. Here we used a meta-analytic approach to quantify the magnitude and direction of subsidy inputs across the freshwater-land interface and to determine subsequent responses in recipient animals. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems differed in the magnitude of subsidies they received, with aquatic ecosystems generally receiving higher subsidies than terrestrial ecosystems. Surprisingly, and despite the large discrepancy in magnitude, the contribution of these subsidies to animal carbon inferred from stable isotope composition did not differ between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, likely due to the differences in subsidy quality. The contribution of allochthonous subsidies was highest to primary consumers and predators, suggesting that bottom-up and top-down effects may be affected considerably by the input of allochthonous resources. Future work on subsidies will profit from a food web dynamic approach including indirect trophic interactions and propagating effects. Key words: allochthonous; autochthonous; bottom-up; cross-ecosystem; food web dynamics; resource subsidy; top-down.},

We used long-term data from three reference streams (covering 24 stream-years) and 13-year whole-stream organic matter manipulations to investigate the inﬂuence of terrestrial detrital quantity and quality on benthic invertebrate community structure, abundance, biomass, and secondary production in rockface (RF) and mixed substrates (MS) of forested headwater streams. Using a mesh canopy covering the entire treatment stream, we examined effects of litter exclusion, small- and large-wood removal, and addition of artiﬁcial wood (PVC) and leaves of varying quality on organic matter standing crops and invertebrate community structure and function. We assessed differences in functional feeding group distribution between substrate types as inﬂuenced by organic matter manipulations and long-term patterns of predator and prey production in manipulated vs. reference years. Particulate organic matter standing crops in MS of the treatment stream declined drastically with each successive year of litter exclusion, approaching zero after three years. Monthly invertebrate biomass and annual secondary production was positively related to benthic organic matter in the MS habitats. Rockface habitats exhibited fewer changes than MS habitats across all organic matter manipulations. With leaf addition, the patterns of functional group distribution among MS and RF habitats returned to patterns seen in reference streams. Secondary production per unit organic matter standing crop was greatest for the leaf addition period, followed by the reference streams, and signiﬁcantly less for the litter exclusion and wood removal periods. These data indicate that the limited organic matter remaining in the stream following litter exclusion and wood removal was more refractory than that in the reference streams, whereas the added leaf material was more labile and readily converted into invertebrate production. Predator production and total production were tightly coupled in reference and treatment streams, indicating strong relationships between predators and their prey. Results from the artiﬁcial wood addition demonstrate that physical structure alone will not restore invertebrate productivity without detrital resources from the riparian forest. Our long-term studies conducted over three decades at the ecosystem scale unequivocally show the necessity of maintaining and restoring aquatic–terrestrial linkages in forested headwater streams.},

We experimentally tested how neighbouring communities indirectly in uence each other in absence of dispersal, via resource exchanges. Using two-patch microcosm meta-ecosystems, we manipulated community composition and dynamics, by varying separately species key functional traits (autotroph versus heterotroph species and size of consumer species) and trophic structure of aquatic communities (species growing alone or in presence of competitors or predators). We then analysed the e ects of species functional traits and trophic structure on communities connected through spatial subsidies in the absence of actual dispersal. Both functional traits and trophic structure strongly a ected dynamics across neighbouring communities. Heterotroph communities connected to autotroph neighbours developed better than with heterotroph neighbours, such that coexistence of competitors was determined by the functional traits of the neighbouring community. Densities in autotroph communities were also strikingly higher when receiving subsidies from heterotroph communities compared to their own subsidies when grown in isolated ecosystems. In contrast, communities connected to predator-dominated ecosystems collapsed, without any direct contact with the predators. Our results demonstrate that because community composition and structure modify the distribution of biomass within a community, they may also a ect communities connected through subsidies through quantitative and qualitative changes of detritus ows. is stresses that ecosystem management should account for such interdependencies mediated by spatial subsidies, given that local community alterations cascade across space onto other ecosystems even if species dispersal is completely absent.},

The measurements usually made include the transfer rates of such biologically important materials as oxygen, particulate carbon, and ammonia between water and sediment. We have developed inverse analysis techniques that produce descriptions which include material flows between trophic groups within the sediments. The techniques use a limited set of process rate and biomass measurements and known physiological and chemical information. Estimated material flows include rates of consun{\textasciitilde}ption,production, respiration, excretion, and egestion of the major trophic groups in benthic food webs. We analyzed benthic communities in a lowoxygen environment (Santa Monica Basin) and in a higher-oxygen environment on the conhnental slope (Patton Escarpment),both bordering southern Cahfornia (USA).The inverse analyses suggested that the low oxygen community was dominated by anaerobic protozoa and bactena and supported only a small populations of grazers. The dominance of bacteria with high growth rates caused sedimentary detrital carbon and nitrogen there to decompose in a few days. The Patton Escarpment community, overlain with oxygen-rich water, had a more complex food web dominated by the higher trophic level protozoa, meiofauna, and macrofauna. We suggest that carbon and nitrogen were retained in the biomass of these larger grazers for months. The analyses showed that grazers and microbial organisms speciahze in using resources of different nutritional quality. Specialization of this type may have led to a more complete oxidation of sedimenting detritus at Patton Escarpment than at Santa Monica Basin. Organisms in both food webs had low gross production efficiencies that averaged 10\% at the Patton Escarpment and 7 \% at the Santa Monica Basin sites. These results suggest that inverse analysis can be a powerful tool to analyze benthic communities.},

We further distinguish environmental heterogeneity from species trait heterogeneity as determinants of keystoneness.

A meta-ecosystem is deﬁned as a set of ecosystems connected by spatial ﬂows of energy, materials and organisms across ecosystem boundaries. This concept provides a powerful theoretical tool to understand the emergent properties that arise from spatial coupling of local ecosystems, such as global source–sink constraints, diversity–productivity patterns, stabilization of ecosystem processes and indirect interactions at landscape or regional scales. The meta-ecosystem perspective thereby has the potential to integrate the perspectives of community and landscape ecology, to provide novel fundamental insights into the dynamics and functioning of ecosystems from local to global scales, and to increase our ability to predict the consequences of land-use changes on biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services to human societies.},

These effects occurred in plots that integrated different ecosystem types (i.e., metaecosystems) and were consistent over vast environmental and altitudinal gradients. The BEF relations we report are as strong or even exceed the ones found in small-scale experiments, despite different community assembly processes and a species pool comprising nearly 2,000 vascular plant species. Growing season length increased progressively over the observation period, and this shift was accelerated in more diverse plots, suggesting that a large species pool is important for adaption to climate change.

            Tropical forests modify the conditions they depend on through feedbacks at different spatial scales. These feedbacks shape the hysteresis (history-dependence) of tropical forests, thus controlling their resilience to deforestation and response to climate change. Here, we determine the emergent hysteresis from local-scale tipping points and regional-scale forest-rainfall feedbacks across the tropics under the recent climate and a severe climate-change scenario. By integrating remote sensing, a global hydrological model, and detailed atmospheric moisture tracking simulations, we find that forest-rainfall feedback expands the geographic range of possible forest distributions, especially in the Amazon. The Amazon forest could partially recover from complete deforestation, but may lose that resilience later this century. The Congo forest currently lacks resilience, but is predicted to gain it under climate change, whereas forests in Australasia are resilient under both current and future climates. Our results show how tropical forests shape their own distributions and create the climatic conditions that enable them.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems constantly face disturbances which vary in their spatial and temporal features, yet little is known on how these features affect ecosystem recovery and persistence, i.e., ecosystem stability. We address this issue by considering three ecosystem models with different local dynamics, and ask how their stability properties depend on the spatial and temporal properties of disturbances. We measure the spatial dimension of disturbances by their spatial extent while controlling for their overall strength, and their temporal dimension by the average frequency of random disturbance events. Our models show that the return to equilibrium following a disturbance depends strongly on the disturbance’s extent, due to rescue effects mediated by dispersal. We then reveal a direct relation between the temporal variability caused by repeated disturbances and the recovery from an isolated disturbance event. Although this could suggest a trivial dependency of ecosystem response on disturbance frequency, we ﬁnd that this is true only up to a frequency threshold, which depends on both the disturbance spatial features and the ecosystem dynamics. Beyond this threshold the response changes qualitatively, displaying spatial clusters of disturbed regions, causing an increase in variability, and even a system-wide collapse for ecosystems with alternative stable states. Thus, spanning the spatial dimension of disturbances is a way to probe the underlying dynamics of an ecosystem. Furthermore, considering spatial and temporal dimensions of disturbances in conjunction is necessary to predict ecosystem responses with dramatic ecological consequences, such as regime shifts or population extinction.},

First without dispersal, a high variance of competition strength leads to the emergence of organism-like communities due to the presence of alternative stable states, while weak and uniform interactions induce gradual changes in species composition.

Estimation of the degree of a polynomial potential allows us to derive the number of potential wells in a system. The method correctly detects changes in the number of wells in artificial data. In ice-core proxy records of Greenland paleotemperature, a reduction in the number of climate states from two to one is detected sometime prior to the last glacial maximum (LGM), 23–19 kyr BP. This result is also found in analysis of Greenland Ca data. The bifurcation can be interpreted as loss of stability of the warm interstadial state of the Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events. The proposed method can be applied to a wide range of geophysical time series exhibiting bifurcations.},

	abstract = {Changes in species composition of communities seem to proceed gradually at ﬁrst sight, but remarkably rapid shifts are known to occur. Although disrupting disturbances seem an obvious explanation for such shifts, evidence for large disturbances is not always apparent. Here we show that complex communities tend to move through occasional catastrophic shifts in response to gradual environmental change or evolution. This tendency is caused by multiple attractors that may exist in such systems. We show that alternative attractors arise robustly in randomly generated multispecies models, especially if competition is symmetrical and if interspeciﬁc competition is allowed to exceed intraspeciﬁc competition. Inclusion of predators as a second trophic level did not alter the results greatly, although it reduced the probability of alternative attractors somewhat. These results suggest that alternative attractors may commonly arise from interactions between large numbers of species. Consequently, the response of complex communities to environmental change is expected to be characterized by hysteresis and sudden shifts. Some unexplained regime shifts observed in ecosystems could be related to alternative attractors arising from complex species interactions. Additionally, our results support the idea that ancient mass extinctions may partly be due to an intrinsic loss of stability of species conﬁgurations.},

However, a transition into another state may often be invoked by a series of minor synergistic perturbations rather than a single big one.

We use time series to fit a model that captures the stochastic as well as the deterministic components. The model is then used to estimate the mean exit time from the basin of attraction. This approach offers a fresh angle to anticipating the chance of a critical transition at a time when high-resolution time series are becoming increasingly available.},

Yet despite this well-earned reputation, noise is often interesting in its own right: noise can induce novel phenomena that could not be understood from some underlying deterministic model alone. Nor is all noise the same, and close examination of differences in frequency, colour or magnitude can reveal insights that would otherwise be inaccessible. Yet with each aspect of stochasticity leading to some new or unexpected behaviour, the time is right to move beyond the familiar refrain of “everything is important” (Bjørnstad \& Grenfell 2001). Stochastic phenomena can suggest new ways of inferring process from pattern, and thus spark more dialog between theory and empirical perspectives that best advances the ﬁeld as a whole. I highlight a few compelling examples, while observing that the study of stochastic phenomena are only beginning to make this translation into empirical inference. There are rich opportunities at this interface in the years ahead.},

	abstract = {Changing conditions may lead to sudden shifts in the state of ecosystems when critical thresholds are passed. Some well-studied drivers of such transitions lead to predictable outcomes such as a turbid lake or a degraded landscape. Many ecosystems are, however, complex systems of many interacting species. While detecting upcoming transitions in such systems is challenging, predicting what comes after a critical transition is terra incognita altogether. The problem is that complex ecosystems may shift to many different, alternative states. Whether an impending transition has minor, positive or catastrophic effects is thus unclear. Some systems may, however, behave more predictably than others. The dynamics of mutualistic communities can be expected to be relatively simple, because delayed negative feedbacks leading to oscillatory or other complex dynamics are weak. Here, we address the question of whether this relative simplicity allows us to foresee a community’s future state. As a case study, we use a model of a bipartite mutualistic network and show that a network’s post-transition state is indicated by the way in which a system recovers from minor disturbances. Similar results obtained with a unipartite model of facilitation suggest that our results are of relevance to a wide range of mutualistic systems.},

Data collection
The data were collected in Spain, Greece and Morocco (Table 1). For each of these areas, the grazing history is well-known, and the grazing system is traditional. Three grazing pressures were identified in each area: low, medium and high. Animals (goats and sheep) were followed in the field. Their movement (located by Global Positioning System, GPS, and transferred to a map in a Geographic Information System) and the time spent in each site were recorded. Effective stocking rate was calculated as the average stocking rate multiplied by the percentage of time each grazing site was used28. Vegetation surveys were conducted in 2000 from April to June28. Transects were laid out, and the vegetation cover under the tape was recorded by measuring the starting and end points (in centimetres) of each species. We note that this is a one-dimensional measure, but the transect method is meant to give us an estimation of the patch sizes.
Data analysis
For each transect, the number and the sizes of the patches were calculated. If P {\textless} 0.05, the truncated power-law model was kept as the best model describing the data. For these statistical analyses, we removed the patch sizes that were only present once to minimize the effect of the transect sizes (those in Morocco were different from those in Greece and Spain). Being only present for a small fraction of the year, annuals were excluded from the analyses.
Model definition
At the cell level, our model is stochastic: each of the possible events that applies to a cell occurs with a probability per unit of time (that is, a rate). These rates can depend on the state of the four nearest neighbours. We call ρσ the fraction of \{σ\}-cells in the lattice (σ is +, 0 or -), and qσ{\textbar}σ' the fraction of \{σ\}-cells in the neighbourhood of a \{σ'\}-cell. We express the colonization rate of a \{0\}-cell as: , where β represents the intrinsic seed production rate per vegetation cell multiplied by the survival and the germination probabilities; δ is the fraction of seeds dispersed all over the lattice (1 - δ is the fraction dispersed in the nearest neighbourhood); G describes how seedling establishment depends on competition for resources. For simplicity, G is expressed as a linear function of ρ+: , where ε is the establishment probability of seeds in a system without vegetation and g is the competitive effect of \{+\}-cells on the establishment of new individuals. Let b be βε. We assume that mortality is density-independent: . Degradation of the soil of a \{0\}-cell occurs at a density-independent rate: . Seeds cannot germinate on \{-\}-cells. Regeneration of a \{-\}-cell occurs at rate , with r the regeneration rate of a \{-\}-cell without vegetation in its neighbourhood. Local facilitation f is the positive effect of neighbouring \{+\}-cells on regeneration. A higher local facilitation means that, for a given number of \{+\}-cells in the neighbourhood of a \{-\}-cell, the regeneration of the \{-\}-cell is faster.
Model analysis
Once the densities reached a stationary state, the number and size of the vegetation patches were calculated at each time step during 2,000 time steps. Patch-size distributions were obtained by averaging the values of these 2,000 time steps30. The size of a patch is the number of cells that constitutes it. Patch-size distributions have a different range of ordinate values in the model and in the data. In the model, we indeed averaged the distributions over 2,000 time steps, whereas in the data we only have one distribution per site. We modelled grazing pressure as a higher mortality of \{+\}-cells. We used the correlation approximation26 to analyse our model3. This method allowed the numerical derivation of bifurcation diagrams with the software CONTENT3,27.

	abstract = {Many dynamical systems, including lakes, organisms, ocean circulation patterns, or financial markets, are now thought to have tipping points where critical transitions to a contrasting state can happen. Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called ‘early warning signals’, and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems can show sudden and persistent changes in state despite only incremental changes in drivers. Such critical transitions are difficult to predict, because the state of the system often shows little change before the transition. Early-warning indicators (EWIs) are hypothesized to signal the loss of system resilience and have been shown to precede critical transitions in theoretical models, paleo-climate time series, and in laboratory as well as whole lake experiments. The generalizability of EWIs for detecting critical transitions in empirical time series of natural aquatic ecosystems remains largely untested, however. Here we assessed four commonly used EWIs on long-term datasets of five freshwater ecosystems that have experienced sudden, persistent transitions and for which the relevant ecological mechanisms and drivers are well understood. These case studies were categorized by three mechanisms that can generate critical transitions between alternative states: competition, trophic cascade, and intraguild predation. Although EWIs could be detected in most of the case studies, agreement among the four indicators was low. In some cases, EWIs were detected considerably ahead of the transition. Nonetheless, our results show that at present, EWIs do not provide reliable and consistent signals of impending critical transitions despite using some of the best routinely monitored freshwater ecosystems. Our analysis strongly suggests that a priori knowledge of the underlying mechanisms driving ecosystem transitions is necessary to identify relevant state variables for successfully monitoring EWIs.},

Different metrics are used to assess the stability of ecological systems, and the choice of one metric over another may result in conflicting conclusions. Although each of the multitude of metrics is useful for answering a specific question about stability, the relationship among metrics is poorly understood. Such lack of understanding prevents scientists from developing a unified concept of stability. Instead, by investigating these relationships we can unveil how many dimensions of stability there are (i.e., in how many independent components stability metrics can be grouped), which should help build a more comprehensive concept of stability. Here we simultaneously measured 27 stability metrics frequently used in ecological studies. Our approach is based on dynamical simulations of multispecies trophic communities under different perturbation scenarios. Mapping the relationships between the metrics revealed that they can be lumped into 3 main groups of relatively independent stability components: early response to pulse, sensitivities to press, and distance to threshold. Selecting metrics from each of these groups allows a more accurate and comprehensive quantification of the overall stability of ecological communities. These results contribute to improving our understanding and assessment of stability in ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Transitions between regimes with radically different properties are ubiquitous in nature. Such transitions can occur either smoothly or in an abrupt and catastrophic fashion. Important examples of the latter can be found in ecology, climate sciences, and economics, to name a few, where regime shifts have catastrophic consequences that are mostly irreversible (e.g., desertification, coral reef collapses, and market crashes). Predicting and preventing these abrupt transitions remains a challenging and important task. Usually, simple deterministic equations are used to model and rationalize these complex situations. However, stochastic effects might have a profound effect. Here we use 1D and 2D spatially explicit models to show that intrinsic (demographic) stochasticity can alter deterministic predictions dramatically, especially in the presence of other realistic features such as limited mobility or spatial heterogeneity. In particular, these ingredients can alter the possibility of catastrophic shifts by giving rise to much smoother and easily reversible continuous ones. The ideas presented here can help further understand catastrophic shifts and contribute to the discussion about the possibility of preventing such shifts to minimize their disruptive ecological, economic, and societal consequences.},

	abstract = {Although alternative stable states are commonly found in simple models, it seems reasonable to assume that the response of real ecosystems to environmental change should often be smoothed by spatial heterogeneity and other stabilizing mechanisms. Here, we systematically explore the effect of spatial heterogeneity on regime shifts for three different models, which we run on a one-dimensional lattice with different spatial distributions of an environmental factor (e.g., soil fertility, water level). If dispersion between patches is negligible, the response to gradual change in some overall stressor (e.g., precipitation, nutrient load) is straightforward. Because of the environmental heterogeneity, each patch shifts to the other stable state at different values of the overall control variable. Therefore, the response of the ecosystem as a whole is gradual (i.e., the average of many asynchronous small shifts) instead of catastrophic. However, in response to a reverse change in the global stressor, the system always shows hysteresis, as each individual patch shifts back to the original state at a different value of the control parameter than the critical threshold for the forward shift. If dispersion between patches occurs, the response to change in the overall control parameter becomes dependent on the spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity. If the environmental parameter is randomly distributed in space, the overall response tends to remain surprisingly catastrophic, and hysteresis is hardly reduced as compared to the homogeneous case. By contrast, in a smooth environmental gradient, the response of the overall system is gradual, and hysteresis is much smaller. In fact, hysteresis is largely reduced to the initial phases, in which none of the patches have shifted to the alternative state yet. As soon as the ﬁrst patch shifts, a domino effect occurs, pushing over the neighboring patches. In conclusion, our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity may weaken the tendency for large-scale catastrophic regime shifts if dispersion is unimportant or if local environmental characteristics vary along a smooth gradient.},

	abstract = {Genetic data are often used to assess ‘population connectivity’ because it is difficult to measure dispersal directly at large spatial scales. Genetic connectivity, however, depends primarily on the absolute number of dispersers among populations, whereas demographic connectivity depends on the relative contributions to population growth rates of dispersal vs. local recruitment (i.e. survival and reproduction of residents). Although many questions are best answered with data on genetic connectivity, genetic data alone provide little information on demographic connectivity. The importance of demographic connectivity is clear when the elimination of immigration results in a shift from stable or positive population growth to negative population growth. Otherwise, the amount of dispersal required for demographic connectivity depends on the context (e.g. conservation or harvest management), and even high dispersal rates may not indicate demographic interdependence. Therefore, it is risky to infer the importance of demographic connectivity without information on local demographic rates and how those rates vary over time. Genetic methods can provide insight on demographic connectivity when combined with these local demographic rates, data on movement behaviour, or estimates of reproductive success of immigrants and residents. We also consider the strengths and limitations of genetic measures of connectivity and discuss three concepts of genetic connectivity that depend upon the evolutionary criteria of interest: inbreeding connectivity, drift connectivity, and adaptive connectivity. To conclude, we describe alternative approaches for assessing population connectivity, highlighting the value of combining genetic data with capture-mark-recapture methods or other direct measures of movement to elucidate the complex role of dispersal in natural populations.},

	abstract = {There is currently a poor understanding of the nature and extent of long-distance seed dispersal, largely due to the inherent difficulty of detection. New statistical approaches and molecular markers offer the potential to accurately address this issue. A log-likelihood population allocation test (AFLPOP) was applied to a plant metapopulation to characterize interpopulation seed dispersal. Banksia hookeriana is a fire-killed shrub, restricted to sandy dune crests in fire-prone shrublands of the Eneabba sandplain, southwest Australia. Population genetic variation was assessed for 221 individuals sampled from 21 adjacent dune-crest populations of B. hookeriana using amplified fragment length polymorphism. Genetic diversity was high, with 175 of 183 (96\%) amplified fragment length polymorphism markers polymorphic. Of the total genetic diversity, 8\% was partitioned among populations by AMOVA and FST. There was no relationship between genetic diversity within populations and population demographic parameters such as population size and sample size. A population allocation test on these data unambiguously assigned 177 of 221 (80.1\%) individuals to a single population. Of these, 171 (77.4\% of total) were assigned to the population from which they were sampled and 6 (2.7\% of total) were assigned to a known population other than the one from which they were sampled. A further 9 (4.1\% of total) were assigned to outside the sampled metapopulation area, and 35 individuals (15.8\%) could not be assigned unambiguously to any particular population. These results suggest that both the extent [15 of 221 (6.8\%) individuals originating from a population other than the one in which they occur] and distance (1.6 to {\textgreater} 2.5 km), of seed dispersal between dune-crest populations is greater than expected from previous studies. The extent of long-distance interpopulation seed dispersal observed provides a basis for explaining the survival of populations of the firekilled B. hookeriana in a landscape experiencing frequent fire, where local extinctions and recolonizations may be a regular occurrence.},

	abstract = {Some of the major challenges in seagrass restoration on exposed open coasts are the choice of transplant design that is optimal for coastlines periodically exposed to high water motion, and understanding the survival and dynamics of the transplanted areas on a long time-scale over many years. To contribute to a better understanding of these challenges, we describe here part of a large-scale seagrass restoration program conducted in a Marine Park in Portugal. The goal of this study was to infer if it was possible to recover seagrass habitat in this region, in order to restore its ecosystem functions. To infer which methods would produce better long term persistence to recover seagrass habitat, three factors were assessed: donor seagrass species, transplant season, source location. Monitoring was done three times a year for 8 years, in which areas and densities of the planted units were measured, to assess survival and growth. The best results were obtained with the species Zostera marina transplanted during spring and summer as compared to Zostera noltii and Cymodocea nodosa. Long-term persistence of established (well rooted) transplants was mainly affected by extreme winter storms but there was evidence of ﬁsh grazing effects also. Our results indicate that persistence assessments should be done in the long term, as all transplants were successful (survived and grew initially) in the short term, but were not resistant in the long term after a winter with exceptionally strong storms. The interesting observation that only the largest (11 m2) transplanted plot of Z. marina persisted over a long time, increasing to 103 m2 in 8 years, overcoming storms and grazing, raised the hypothesis that for a successful shift to a vegetated state it might be necessary to overpass a minimum critical size or tipping point. This hypothesis was therefore tested with replicates from two donor populations and results showed effects of size and donor population, as only the larger planting units (PUs) from one donor population persisted and expanded. It is recommended that in future habitat restoration efforts large PUs are considered.},

	abstract = {Understanding how dispersal inﬂuences the dynamics of spatially distributed populations is a major priority of both basic and applied ecologists. Two well-known effects of dispersal are spatial synchrony (positively correlated population dynamics at different points in space) and dispersal-induced stability (the phenomenon whereby populations have simpler or less extinction-prone dynamics when they are linked by dispersal than when they are isolated). Although both these effects of dispersal should occur simultaneously, they have primarily been studied separately. Herein, I summarise evidence from the literature that these effects are expected to interact, and I use a series of models to characterise that interaction. In particular, I explore the observation that although dispersal can promote both synchrony and stability singly, it is widely held that synchrony paradoxically prevents dispersal-induced stability. I show here that in many realistic scenarios, dispersal is expected to promote both synchrony and stability at once despite this apparent destabilising inﬂuence of synchrony. This work demonstrates that studying the spatial and temporal impacts of dispersal together will be vital for the conservation and management of the many communities for which human activities are altering natural dispersal rates.},

	abstract = {Dispersal costs can be classiﬁed into energetic, time, risk and opportunity costs and may be levied directly or deferred during departure, transfer and settlement. They may equally be incurred during life stages before the actual dispersal event through investments in special morphologies. Because costs will eventually determine the performance of dispersing individuals and the evolution of dispersal, we here provide an extensive review on the different cost types that occur during dispersal in a wide array of organisms, ranging from micro-organisms to plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. In general, costs of transfer have been more widely documented in actively dispersing organisms, in contrast to a greater focus on costs during departure and settlement in plants and animals with a passive transfer phase. Costs related to the development of speciﬁc dispersal attributes appear to be much more prominent than previously accepted. Because costs induce trade-offs, they give rise to covariation between dispersal and other life-history traits at different scales of organismal organisation. The consequences of (i) the presence and magnitude of different costs during different phases of the dispersal process, and (ii) their internal organisation through covariation with other life-history traits, are synthesised with respect to potential consequences for species conservation and the need for development of a new generation of spatial simulation models.},

	abstract = {A rich body of knowledge links biodiversity to ecosystem functioning (BEF), but it is primarily focused on small scales. We review the current theory and identify six expectations for scale dependence in the BEF relationship: (1) a nonlinear change in the slope of the BEF relationship with spatial scale; (2) a scale-dependent relationship between ecosystem stability and spatial extent; (3) coexistence within and among sites will result in a positive BEF relationship at larger scales; (4) temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability affects species turnover and thus the change in BEF slope with scale; (5) connectivity in metacommunities generates nonlinear BEF and stability relationships by affecting population synchrony at local and regional scales; (6) spatial scaling in food web structure and diversity will generate scale dependence in ecosystem functioning. We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales. We also show how anthropogenic land cover change may alter the scaling of the BEF relationship. New research on the role of scale in BEF will guide policy linking the goals of managing biodiversity and ecosystems.},

Show that in contrast to well-mixed systems, resilience in a homogeneous spatial setting does not decrease gradually as a bifurcation point is approached. Instead, as an environmental driver changes, the present dominant state remains virtually ‘indestructible’, until at a critical point (the Maxwell point) its resilience drops sharply in the sense that even a very local disturbance can cause a domino effect leading eventually to a landscape-wide shift to the alternative state.
Overall however, hysteresis may mostly disappear in a spatial context as one of both alternative states will always tend to be dominant

	abstract = {The functional response of a consumer is the relationship between its consumption rate and the abundance of its food. A functional response is said to be of type I if  consumption rate increases linearly with food abundance up to a threshold level at  which it remains constant. According to conventional wisdom, such type I responses  are more frequent among filter feeders than among other consumers. However, the  validity of this claim has never been tested. We review 814 functional responses  from 235 studies, thereby showing that type I responses are not only exceptionally  frequent among filter feeders but that they have only been reported from these  consumers. These findings can be understood by considering the conditions that a  consumer must fulfil in order to show a type I response. First, the handling  condition: the consumer must have a negligibly small handling time (i.e. the time  needed for capturing and eating a food item), or it must be able to search for and  to capture food while handling other food. Second, the satiation condition: unless  its gut is completely filled and gut passage time is minimal, the consumer must  search for food at a maximal rate with maximal effort. It thus has to spend much  time on foraging (i.e. searching for food and handling it). Our functional response  review suggests that only filter feeders sometimes meet both of these conditions.  This suggestion is reasonable because filter feeders typically fulfil the handling  condition and can meet the satiation condition without losing time, for they are, by  contrast to non-filter feeders, able simultaneously to perform foraging and  non-foraging activities, such as migration or reproduction.},

	abstract = {Abstract The metacommunity concept has the potential to integrate local and regional dynamics within a general community ecology framework. To this end, the concept must move beyond the discrete archetypes that have largely defined it (e.g. neutral vs. species sorting) and better incorporate local scale species interactions and coexistence mechanisms. Here, we present a fundamental reconception of the framework that explicitly links local coexistence theory to the spatial processes inherent to metacommunity theory, allowing for a continuous range of competitive community dynamics. These dynamics emerge from the three underlying processes that shape ecological communities: (1) density-independent responses to abiotic conditions, (2) density-dependent biotic interactions and (3) dispersal. Stochasticity is incorporated in the demographic realisation of each of these processes. We formalise this framework using a simulation model that explores a wide range of competitive metacommunity dynamics by varying the strength of the underlying processes. Using this model and framework, we show how existing theories, including the traditional metacommunity archetypes, are linked by this common set of processes. We then use the model to generate new hypotheses about how the three processes combine to interactively shape diversity, functioning and stability within metacommunities.},

	abstract = {A spatial metapopulation is a mosaic of interconnected patch populations. The complex routes of colonization between the patches are governed by the metapopulation's dispersal network. Over the past two decades, there has been considerable interest in uncovering the effects of dispersal network topology and its symmetry on metapopulation persistence. While most studies find that the level of symmetry in dispersal pattern enhances persistence, some have reached the conclusion that symmetry has at most a minor effect. In this work, we present a new perspective on the debate. We study properties of the in- and out-degree distribution of patches in the metapopulation which define the number of dispersal routes into and out of a particular patch, respectively. By analysing the spectral radius of the dispersal matrices, we confirm that a higher level of symmetry has only a marginal impact on persistence. We continue to analyse different properties of the in–out degree distribution, namely the ‘in–out degree correlation’ (IODC) and degree heterogeneity, and find their relationship to metapopulation persistence. Our analysis shows that, in contrast to symmetry, the in–out degree distribution and particularly, the IODC are dominant factors controlling persistence.},

	abstract = {The Earth’s climate system is highly nonlinear: inputs and outputs are not proportional, change is often episodic and abrupt, rather than slow and gradual, and multiple equilibria are the norm. While this is widely accepted, there is a relatively poor understanding of the different types of nonlinearities, how they manifest under various conditions, and whether they reﬂect a climate system driven by astronomical forcings, by internal feedbacks, or by a combination of both. In this paper, after a brief tutorial on the basics of climate nonlinearity, we provide a number of illustrative examples and highlight key mechanisms that give rise to nonlinear behavior, address scale and methodological issues, suggest a robust alternative to prediction that is based on using integrated assessments within the framework of vulnerability studies and, lastly, recommend a number of research priorities and the establishment of education programs in Earth Systems Science. It is imperative that the Earth’s climate system research community embraces this nonlinear paradigm if we are to move forward in the assessment of the human inﬂuence on climate.},

In mesic grasslands, ﬁre frequency regulates transition from grass- to shrub-dominated system states. It is uncertain, however, if increasing ﬁre frequency can reverse shrub expansion, or if grass-shrub dynamics exhibit hysteresis. We implemented annual burning in two infrequently burned grasslands and ceased burning in two grasslands burned annually. With annual ﬁres, grassland composition converged on that of long-term annually burned vegetation due to rapid recovery of grass cover, although shrubs persisted. When annual burning ceased, shrub cover increased, but community composition did not converge with a long-term infrequently burned reference site because of stochastic and lagged dispersal by shrubs, reﬂecting hysteresis. Our results demonstrated that annual burning can slow, but not reverse, shrub encroachment. In addition, reversing ﬁre frequencies resulted in hysteresis because vegetation trajectories from grassland to shrubland differed from those of shrubland to grassland.},

This analogy has a long history in ecology and has been used to illustrate ecosystem changes over time where the magnitude of changes required to push the ball from one cup to another represents a regime shift to an alternative state. Another approach for visualizing ecosystem stability, resistance, and resilience involves ordinations of repeated measures of community data or environmental variables and tracking trajectories over time in ordination space. Interestingly, the two approaches have not been linked in a meaningful way. Here, we provide a conceptual link between trajectories of ecological change in ordination space to the ball-and-cup analogy and show how distance-based measures calculated from ordination scores can be used to quantitatively classify and evaluate the relative stability and resilience of ecological systems.},

Here we reveal a strong similarity between patterns of inequality in nature and society, hinting at fundamental unifying mechanisms. We show that chance alone will drive 1\% or less of the community to dominate 50\% of all resources in situations where gains and losses are multiplicative, as in returns on assets or growth rates of populations. Key mechanisms that counteract such hyperdominance include natural enemies in nature and wealth-equalizing institutions in society. However, historical research of European developments over the past millennium suggests that such institutions become ineffective in times of societal upscaling. A corollary is that in a globalizing world, wealth will inevitably be appropriated by a very small fraction of the population unless effective wealth-equalizing institutions emerge at the global level.},

It has long been difficult to quantify resilience directly, forcing practitioners to rely on indirect static indicators of health. However, measurements from wearable electronics and other sources now allow us to analyze the dynamics of physiology and behavior with unsurpassed resolution. The resulting flood of data coincides with the emergence of novel analytical tools for estimating resilience from the pattern of microrecoveries observed in natural time series. Such dynamic indicators of resilience may be used to monitor the risk of systemic failure across systems ranging from organs to entire organisms. These tools invite a fundamental rethinking of our approach to the adaptive management of health and resilience.},

	abstract = {An enduring challenge for ecology is identifying the drivers of ecosystem and population stability. In a spatially explicit context, key features to consider are landscape spatial structure, local interactions, and dispersal. Substantial work has been done on each of these features as a driver of stability, but little is known on the interplay between them. Missing has been a more integrative approach, able to map and identify different dynamical regimes, predicting a system’s response to perturbations. Here we first consider a simple scenario, i.e., the recovery of a homogeneous metapopulation from a single localized pulse disturbance. The analysis of this scenario reveals three fundamental recovery regimes: Isolated Regime when dispersal is not significant, Rescue Regime when dispersal mediates recovery, and Mixing Regime when perturbations spread throughout the system. Despite its simplicity, our approach leads to remarkably general predictions. These include the qualitatively different outcomes of various scenarios of habitat fragmentation, the surprising benefits of local extinctions on population persistence at the transition between regimes, and the productivity shifts of metacommunities in a changing environment. This study thus provides context to known results and insight into future directions of research.},

            Landscape’s spatial structure has vast implications for the dynamics and distribution of species populations and ecological communities. However, the characterization of the structure of spatial networks has not received nearly as much attention as networks of species interactions counterparts. Recent experiments show the dynamical implications of modularity to buffer perturbations, and theory shows that several other processes might be impacted if spatial networks were modular, from disease transmission to gene flow. Yet the question is, are spatial networks actually modular? Even though some case studies have found modular structures, we lack a general answer to that question. Here, I show that modularity is a naturally emergent property of spatial networks. This finding is further reinforced by analyzing real patchy habitats. Furthermore, I show that there is no need for any other biological process other than dispersal in order to generate a significantly modular spatial network. Modularity is explained by the spatial heterogeneity in the density of habitat fragments. The fact that spatial networks are intrinsically modular might have direct consequences for population and evolutionary dynamics. Modules define the spatial limits of populations and the role each habitat fragment plays in ecological dynamics; they become the relevant scale at which a multitude of processes occur.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems may shift abruptly between alternative states in response to environmental perturbations [1–3]. Early warning indicators have been proposed to anticipate such regime shifts, but experimental ﬁeld tests of their validity are rare [4–6]. We exposed rocky intertidal algal canopies to a gradient of press perturbations and recorded the response of associated assemblages over 7 years. Reduced cover and biomass of algal canopies promoted the invasion of algal turfs, driving understory assemblages toward collapse upon total canopy removal. A dynamic model indicated the existence of a critical threshold separating the canopy- and turf-dominated states. We evaluated common indicators of regime shift as the system approached the threshold, including autocorrelation, SD, and skewness [7]. These indicators captured changes in understory cover due to colonization of algal turfs. All indicators increased signiﬁcantly as the system approached the critical threshold, in agreement with theoretical predictions [2, 8, 9]. The performance of indicators changed when we superimposed a pulse disturbance on the press perturbation that ampliﬁed environmental noise. This treatment caused several experimental units to switch repeatedly between the canopyand the turf-dominated state, resulting in a signiﬁcant increase in overall variance of understory cover, a negligible effect on skewness and no effect on autocorrelation. Power analysis indicated that autocorrelation and SD were better suited at anticipating a regime shift under mild and strong ﬂuctuations of the state variable, respectively. Our results suggest that regime shifts may be anticipated under a broad range of ﬂuctuating conditions using the appropriate indicator.},

Unfortunately, it is very difﬁcult to measure ecological resilience in practice. Here we show that the rate of recovery from small perturbations (sometimes called “engineering resilience”) is a remarkably good indicator of ecological resilience. Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift is approached, a phenomenon known in physics as “critical slowing down.” We demonstrate the robust occurrence of critical slowing down in six ecological models and outline a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in recovery rates. In all the models we analyzed, critical slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as an early warning signal. Despite the fact that critical slowing down could also indicate other critical transitions, such as a stable system becoming oscillatory, the robustness of the phenomenon makes it a promising indicator of loss of resilience and the risk of upcoming regime shifts in a system.},

Metapopulation abundance is largely affected by the architecture of the spatial network, although this effect depends on demographic parameters here represented by the extinction-to-colonization ratio (e/c). Thus, for moderate to large e/c-values, regional abundance grows with the heterogeneity of the network, with uniform or random networks having the lowest regional abundances, and scale-free networks having the largest abundance. However, the ranking is reversed for low extinction probabilities, with heterogeneous networks showing the lowest relative abundance. We further explore the mechanisms underlying such results by relating a node’s incidence (average number of time steps the node is occupied) with its degree, and with the average degree of the nodes it interacts with. These results demonstrate the importance of spatial network structure to understanding metapopulation abundance, and serve to determine under what circumstances information on network structure should be complemented with information on the species life-history traits to understand persistence in heterogeneous environments. \& 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples.

Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state.

	abstract = {Regime shifts, i.e., large, persistent, and usually unexpected changes in ecosystems and social-ecological systems, can have major impacts on ecosystem services, and consequently, on human well-being. However, the vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven. Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime shifts and {\textgreater} 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.},

Although there have been a great many papers on the Allee eﬀect, they have mainly referred to only local populations and have not dealt with the relationship between the two. In this paper, we begin with local population dynamics and then construct a model including both local population and metapopulation dynamics. Then we simulate with computer at these two levels. The results indicate that the Allee-like eﬀect in a metapopulation may emerge from the imposed Allee eﬀect at the local population level. This threshold fraction of occupied patches below which the metapopulation goes extinct is seriously aﬀected by the per capita migration rate, the survival rate during migration and the initial population size on the occupied patches. We also ﬁnd that severe demographic stochasticity may compound the metapopulation extinction risk posed by the Allee eﬀect. These conclusions are helpful for nature conservation, especially for the preservation of rare species.},

	abstract = {The current decline of the highly endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) may be partly due to the population dynamics induced by their social system. African wild dogs are obligate co-operators, and their need for helpers could generate inverse density dependence at the pack level. We show, through a mathematical model, that this can create an Allee effect, leading to a lower population size and a higher risk of population extinction, compared to populations with direct density dependence. This is due to three different processes. All three processes can increase population extinction individually and probably occur simultaneously in African wild dogs. First, inverse density dependence causes signiﬁcantly higher rates of pack extinction. Second, it also increases the probability of failure to colonize territories by founders. Third, the Allee effect at the pack level (with a critical number of individuals), generates an Allee effect at the population level (with a critical number of packs). These three processes are likely to apply to other obligate co-operative breeders. Furthermore, our results suggest that habitat fragmentation and destruction, as well as increased human pressure, increase the effects of inverse density dependence. Direct and indirect anthropogenic effects may thus be more detrimental to obligate co-operative breeders than to other species.},

The method allows several predictions about changes in the degree of specialization of the diet as the numbers of different prey organisms change. For example, a more productive environment should lead to more restricted diet in numbers of different species eaten. In a patchy environment, however, this will not apply to predators that spend most of their time searching. Moreover, larger patches are used in a more specialized way than smaller patches.},

An example of a three-species interaction is also presented. Variations of the graph are introduced, and it is shown that an otherwise unstable interaction may be stabilized by the presence of either an inviolable prey hiding place, or extremely low predation pressure at moderate predator and high prey densities, or another predator-limiting resource. Stability is always conferred when the predator is severely limited at its equilibrium density by one of its resources other than its supply of prey. Predators should tend to be limited at their equilibrium densities by more than one of their resources. When either of the two foregoing situations pertains, regular predator-prey oscillations should not be observable. The stability of the interaction close to equilibrium was found to depend exclusively, in the mathematically-continuous model, upon the slopes of two lines in the graph at equilibrium. Stability can be asymptotic rather than oscillatory in type. An equation for the period of oscillatory interactions is also advanced. The effects of Natural Selection on the isoclines, and thus the stability, is not clear-cut. Selection of the prey tends to stabilize the interaction; the opposite is true for selection on the predator.},

Because of their important ecological and economic consequences, recent research has focused on devising early warning signals for anticipating such abrupt ecological transitions. In particular, theoretical studies show that changes in spatial characteristics of the system could provide early warnings of approaching transitions. However, the empirical validation of these indicators lag behind their theoretical developments. Here, we summarize a range of currently available spatial early warning signals, suggest potential null models to interpret their trends, and apply them to three simulated spatial data sets of systems undergoing an abrupt transition. In addition to providing a step-by-step methodology for applying these signals to spatial data sets, we propose a statistical toolbox that may be used to help detect approaching transitions in a wide range of spatial data. We hope that our methodology together with the computer codes will stimulate the application and testing of spatial early warning signals on real spatial data.},

	abstract = {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future. Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and show that they were all preceded by a characteristic slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply independent empirical evidence for the idea that past abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change. Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this is a promising perspective.},

	abstract = {Cross-ecosystem material flows, in the form of inorganic nutrients, detritus and organisms, spatially connect ecosystems and impact food web dynamics. To date research on material flows has focused on the impact of the quantity of these flows and largely ignored their elemental composition, or quality. However, the ratios of elements like carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus can influence the impact material flows have on food web interactions through stoichiometric mismatches between resources and consumers. The type and movement of materials likely vary in their ability to change stoichiometric constraints within the recipient ecosystem and materials may undergo changes in their own stoichiometry during transport. In this literature review we evaluate the importance of cross-ecosystem material flows within the framework of ecological stoichiometry. We explore how movement in space and time impacts the stoichiometry of material flow, as these transformations are essential to consider when assessing the ability of these flows to impact food web productivity and ecosystem functioning. Our review suggests that stoichiometry of cross-ecosystem material flows are highly dynamic and undergo changes during transport across the landscape or from human influence. These material flows can impact recipient organisms if they change stoichiometry of the abiotic medium, or provide resources that have a different stoichiometry to in situ resources. They might also alter consumer excretion rates, in turn altering the availability of nutrients in the recipient ecosystem. These alterations in stoichiometric constraints of recipient organisms can have cascading trophic effects and shape food web dynamics. We highlight significant gaps in the literature and suggest new avenues for research that explore how cross-ecosystem material flows impact recipient ecosystems when considering differences in stoichiometric quality, their movement through the landscape and across ecosystem boundaries, and the nutritional constraints of the recipient organisms.},

At the same time, it is widely recognized that ecological processes are inherently stochastic, and that disturbances and variation in the environment and in the fates of individuals prevent many ecological systems from resting at their theoretical equilibrium. A developing body of stochastic ecological theory aims to bridge the gap between the deterministic tools of classical theory and the stochastic, non-equilibrial questions that real systems present to us. This chapter provides an overview of this developing theory, with an emphasis on approaches that confront the complex interplay between deterministic density dependence, and perturbations. Although intuition may suggest that stochasticity and transient phenomena should obscure ecological understanding, they can actually strengthen it when viewed through the appropriate lens, as illustrated in this chapter.},

According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species’ productivity responses to environmental f luctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performanceenhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental f luctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

Quantifying ecological stability therefore requires inspecting multiple stability properties, such as resistance, recovery, persistence and invariability. Correlations among these properties can reduce the dimensionality of stability, simplifying the study of environmental effects on ecosystems. A key question is how the kind of disturbance affects these correlations. We here investigated the effect of three disturbance types (random, species-speciﬁc, local) applied at four intensity levels, on the dimensionality of stability at the population and community level. We used previously parameterized models that represent ﬁve natural communities, varying in species richness and the number of trophic levels. We found that disturbance type but not intensity affected the dimensionality of stability and only at the population level. The dimensionality of stability also varied greatly among species and communities. Therefore, studying stability cannot be simpliﬁed to using a single metric and multi-dimensional assessments are still to be recommended.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems are defined, studied, and managed according to boundaries constructed to conceptualize patterns of interest at a certain scale and scope. The distinction between ecosystems becomes obscured when resources from multiple origins cross porous boundaries and are assimilated into food webs through repeated trophic transfers. Ecosystem compartments can define bounded localities in a heterogeneous landscape that simultaneously retain and exchange energy in the form of organic matter. Here we developed and tested a framework to quantify reciprocal reliance on cross-boundary resource exchange and calculate the contribution of primary production from adjacent ecosystem compartments cycling through food webs to support consumers at different trophic levels. Under this framework, an integrated ecosystem can be measured and designated when the boundary between spatially distinct compartments is permeable and the bidirectional exchange of resources contributes significantly to sustaining both food webs. Using a desert river and riparian zone as a case study, we demonstrate that resources exchanged across the aquatic–riparian boundary cycle through multiple trophic levels. Furthermore, predators on both sides of the boundary were supported by externally produced resources to a similar extent, indicating this is a tightly integrated river–riparian ecosystem and that changes to either compartment will substantially impact the other. Using published data on lake ecosystems, we demonstrated that benthic and pelagic ecosystem compartments are likely not fully integrated, but differences between lakes could be used to test ecological hypotheses. Finally, we discuss how the integrated ecosystem framework could be applied in urban-preserve and field-forest ecosystems to address a broad range of ecological concepts. Because few systems function in complete isolation, this novel approach has application to research and management strategies globally as ecosystems continue to face novel pressures that precipitate cascading ecological repercussions well beyond a bounded system of focus.},

	abstract = {Explicit consideration of timescales and dynamics is required for an understanding of fundamental issues in ecology. Endogenous dynamics can lead to transient states where asymptotic behavior is very different from dynamics on short timescales. The causes of these kinds of transients can be placed in one of three classes: linear systems with different timescales embedded or exhibiting reactive behavior, the potentially long times to reach synchrony across space for oscillating systems, and the complex dynamics of systems with strong density-dependent (nonlinear) interactions. It is also important to include the potentially disparate timescales inherent in ecological systems when determining the endogenous dynamics. I argue that the dynamics of ecological systems can best be understood as the response, which may include transient dynamics, to exogenous inﬂuences leading to the observed dynamics on ecologically relevant timescales. This view of ecosystem behavior as responses of ecological systems governed by endogenous dynamics to exogenous inﬂuences provides a synthetic way to unify different approaches to population dynamics, to understand mechanisms that determine the distribution and abundance of species, and to manage ecosystems on appropriate timescales. There are implications for theoretical approaches, empirical approaches, and the statistical approaches that bridge theory and observation.},

Here, we estimated the links among environmental conditions, richness, food-­web structure, annual biomass and its temporal stability using a standardised monitoring dataset of 99 stream fish communities spanning from 1995 to 2018. We first revealed that both richness and average trophic level are positively related to annual biomass, with effects of similar strength. Second, we found that community stability is fostered by mean trophic level, while contrary to expectation, it is decreased by species richness. Finally, we found that environmental conditions affect both biomass and its stability mainly via effects on richness and network structure. Strikingly, the effect of species richness on community stability was mediated by population stability rather than synchrony, which contrasts with results from single trophic communities. We discuss the hypothesis that it could be a characteristic of multi-­trophic communities.},

	abstract = {Nutrient limitation to primary productivity and other biological processes is widespread in terrestrial ecosystems, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most common limiting elements, both individually and in combination. Mechanisms that drive P limitation, and their interactions with the N cycle, have received less attention than mechanisms causing N limitation. We identify and discuss six mechanisms that could drive P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. The best known of these is depletion-driven limitation, in which accumulated P losses during long-term soil and ecosystem development contribute to what Walker and Syers termed a ‘‘terminal steady state’’ of profound P depletion and limitation. The other mechanisms are soil barriers that prevent access to P; transactional limitation, in which weathering of P-containing minerals does not keep pace with the supply of other resources; low-P parent materials; P sinks; and anthropogenic changes that increase the supply of other resources (often N) relative to P. We distinguish proximate nutrient limitation (which occurs where additions of a nutrient stimulate biological processes, especially productivity) from ultimate nutrient limitation (where additions of a nutrient can transform ecosystems). Of the mechanisms that drive P limitation, we suggest that depletion, soil barriers, and low-P parent material often cause ultimate limitation because they control the ecosystem mass balance of P. Similarly, demand-independent losses and constraints to N ﬁxation can control the ecosystem-level mass balance of N and cause it to be an ultimate limiting nutrient.},

Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reﬂect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual uniﬁcation across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a ﬁxed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on ﬂows of energy and matter. These ﬁndings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences.},

Recent modelling and conceptual work suggests that stability is a multidimensional construct comprising different response aspects. Using two freshwater mesocosm experiments as case studies, we show how the response to single perturbations can be decomposed in different stability aspects (resistance, resilience, recovery, temporal stability) for both ecosystem functions and community composition. We ﬁnd that extended community recovery is tightly connected to a nearly complete recovery of the function (biomass production), whereas systems with incomplete recovery of the species composition ranged widely in their biomass compared to controls. Moreover, recovery was most complete when either resistance or resilience was high, the latter associated with low temporal stability around the recovery trend. In summary, no single aspect of stability was sufﬁcient to reﬂect the overall stability of the system.},

	abstract = {Many ecosystems, from vegetation to biofilms, are composed of territorial populations that compete for both nutrients and physical space. What are the implications of such spatial organization for biodiversity? To address this question, we developed and analyzed a model of territorial resource competition. In the model, all species obey trade-offs inspired by biophysical constraints on metabolism; the species occupy nonoverlapping territories, while nutrients diffuse in space. We find that the nutrient diffusion time is an important control parameter for both biodiversity and the timescale of population dynamics. Interestingly, fast nutrient diffusion allows the populations of some species to fluctuate to zero, leading to extinctions. Moreover, territorial competition spontaneously gives rise to both multistability and the Allee effect (in which a minimum population is required for survival), so that small perturbations can have major ecological effects. While the assumption of trade-offs allows for the coexistence of more species than the number of nutrients—thus violating the principle of competitive exclusion—overall biodiversity is curbed by the domination of “oligotroph” species. Importantly, in contrast to well-mixed models, spatial structure renders diversity robust to inequalities in metabolic trade-offs. Our results suggest that territorial ecosystems can display high biodiversity and rich dynamics simply due to competition for resources in a spatial community.},

            Habitat fragmentation and eutrophication have strong impacts on biodiversity. Metacommunity research demonstrated that reduction in landscape connectivity may cause biodiversity loss in fragmented landscapes. Food-web research addressed how eutrophication can cause local biodiversity declines. However, there is very limited understanding of their cumulative impacts as they could amplify or cancel each other. Our simulations of meta-food-webs show that dispersal and trophic processes interact through two complementary mechanisms. First, the ‘rescue effect’ maintains local biodiversity by rapid recolonization after a local crash in population densities. Second, the ‘drainage effect’ stabilizes biodiversity by preventing overshooting of population densities on eutrophic patches. In complex food webs on large spatial networks of habitat patches, these effects yield systematically higher biodiversity in heterogeneous than in homogeneous landscapes. Our meta-food-web approach reveals a strong interaction between habitat fragmentation and eutrophication and provides a mechanistic explanation of how landscape heterogeneity promotes biodiversity.},

We show that urban and intensive agricultural landscapes as well as diversity loss destabilize these communities but in different ways: while diversity loss translates into greater population synchrony, urban and intensive agricultural landscapes mainly decrease mean population stability. In addition to highlight the stabilizing effects of diversity on ecologically important but overlooked taxa, our results further reveal new pathways linking anthropogenic activities to diversity and stability.},

Our results demonstrate that metapopulation capacity could be used to predict the persistence of trophic systems such as prey–predator pairs and food chains in fragmented landscapes. In particular, we derive explicit predictions for food chain length as a function of metapopulation capacity, top-down control, and population dynamical parameters. Under certain assumptions, we show that the fraction of empty patches for the basal species provides a useful indicator to predict the length of food chains that a fragmented landscape can support and confirm this prediction for a host–parasitoid interaction. We further show that the impact of habitat changes on biodiversity can be predicted from changes in metapopulation capacity or approximately by changes in the fraction of empty patches. Our study provides an important step toward a spatially explicit theory of trophic metacommunities and a useful tool for predicting their responses to habitat changes.},

We consider a wide array of model features, including interaction types and community structures, known to generate different dynamics for a few species. We combine these features in large simulated communities, and show that equilibrium diversity, functioning, and stability can be predicted analytically using a random model parameterized by a few statistical properties of the community. We give an ecological interpretation of this “disordered” limit where structure fails to emerge from complexity. We also demonstrate that some well-studied interaction patterns remain relevant in large ecosystems, but their impact can be encapsulated in a minimal number of additional parameters.

However, definitive empirical evidence for this phenomenon remains limited to demographically closed ecosystems such as lakes. In more interconnected systems such as temperate rocky reefs, the local relevance of alternative stable states might erode as immigration overwhelms local feedbacks and produces a single stable state. At larger spatial scales, dispersal might counter localized disturbance and feedbacks to synchronize states throughout a region. Here, we quantify how interconnectedness affects the relevance of alternative stable states using dynamical models of California rocky reef communities that incorporate observed environmental stochasticity and feedback loops in kelp–urchin–predator interactions. Our models demonstrate the potential for localized alternative states despite high interconnectedness likely due to feedbacks affecting dispersers as they settle into local communities. Regionally, such feedbacks affecting settlement can produce a mosaic of alternative stable states that span local (10–20 km) scales despite the synchronizing effect of long-distance dispersal. The specific spatial scale and duration of each state predominantly depend on the scales of environmental variation and on local dynamics (here, fishing). Model predictions reflect observed scales of community states in California rocky reefs and suggest how alternative states co-occur in the wide array of marine and terrestrial systems with settlement feedbacks.},

Little attention has, however, been paid to the systemic response of mutualistic communities to global environmental change. Using a modelling approach and merging network theory with theory on critical transitions, we show that the scale and nature of critical transitions is likely to be inﬂuenced by the architecture of mutualistic networks. Speciﬁcally, we show that pollinator populations may collapse suddenly once drivers of pollinator decline reach a critical point. A high connectance and/or nestedness of the mutualistic network increases the capacity of pollinator populations to persist under harsh conditions. However, once a tipping point is reached, pollinator populations collapse simultaneously. Recovering from this single community-wide collapse requires a relatively large improvement of conditions. These ﬁndings may have large implications for our view on the sustainability of pollinator communities and the services they provide.},

	abstract = {There is a growing recognition that ecological systems can spend extended periods of time far away from an asymptotic state, and that ecological understanding will therefore require a deeper appreciation for how long ecological transients arise. Recent work has defined classes of deterministic mechanisms that can lead to long transients. Given the ubiquity of stochasticity in ecological systems, a similar systematic treatment of transients that includes the influence of stochasticity is important. Stochasticity can of course promote the appearance of transient dynamics by preventing systems from settling permanently near their asymptotic state, but stochasticity also interacts with deterministic features to create qualitatively new dynamics. As such, stochasticity may shorten, extend or fundamentally change a system’s transient dynamics. Here, we describe a general framework that is developing for understanding the range of possible outcomes when random processes impact the dynamics of ecological systems over realistic time scales. We emphasize that we can understand the ways in which stochasticity can either extend or reduce the lifetime of transients by studying the interactions between the stochastic and deterministic processes present, and we summarize both the current state of knowledge and avenues for future advances.},

Here, we conducted a sheep-­grazing experiment in a temperate grassland to test grazing effects on the temporal stability of productivity across scales. We found that grazing increased species stability but substantially decreased local community stability due to reduced asynchronous dynamics among species within communities. The negative effect of grazing on local community stability propagated to reduce stability at larger spatial scales. By decreasing biodiversity both within and across communities, grazing reduced biological insurance effects and hence the upscaling of stability from species to communities and further to larger spatial scales. Our study provides the first evidence for the scale dependence of grazing effects on grassland stability through biodiversity. We suggest that ecosystem management should strive to maintain biodiversity across scales to achieve sustainability of grassland ecosystem functions and services.},

	abstract = {Sea urchin barrens are benthic communities on rocky subtidal reefs that are dominated by urchins and coralline algae; in the absence of intense herbivory by urchins, these barrens support luxuriant seaweed communities such as kelp beds (or forests). Barrens can extend over 1000s of km of coastline or occur in small patches (10s to 100s of m) within a kelp bed. They are characterized by low primary productivity and low food-web complexity relative to kelp communities and are generally considered a collapsed state of the kelp ecosystem. To assess the stability of sea urchin barrens and potential for return to a kelp-dominated state, we document temporal and spatial patterns of occurrence of barrens along temperate and polar coasts. We examine the various drivers of phase (or regime) shifts in these areas, the threshold levels of urchin abundance that trigger abrupt changes in ecosystem state, and the feedback mechanisms that stabilize each state. Although longitudinal (decadal) studies are limited, we find evidence in several regions that transitions between barrens and kelp beds are characterized by discontinuous phase shifts, with different thresholds for forward (to barrens) and reverse (to kelp beds) shifts, in accordance with alternative stable-state dynamics. In other areas, barrens may reflect regime shifts associated with large-scale oceanographic changes. Accelerating climate change and increasing anthropogenic impacts play important roles in altering alternative stable-state dynamics and triggering phase shifts. Recovery of the kelp state may be possible through management or remediation measures, but this necessitates a clear understanding of the thresholds and stabilizing factors for a given system.},

Indicators of resilience may help circumvent such limitation by signalling the proximity of ecological systems close to an abrupt transition. However, their successful application strongly depends on the ecosystem under question. Therefore, if we aim to use resilience indicators for ecological management in practice, we need to understand where and how they can be reliably monitored. Here, we test the performance of resilience indicators across species in simple modules of competition to help recognize best-indicator species in a community. We show that diﬀerences in species sensitivity to disturbances in a community is aﬀected by the dominant eigenvector of the linearized system at equilibrium, We then use simulated time series to compare trends in variance and autocorrelation across species and at community level. We found high heterogeneity in the strength of the indicators across species, while community-based indicators scored better on average than indicators at species level. Looking at species features, we found that collapsing and invading species showed strongest trends, but we observed no relationship between the number of species interaction links and indicators. Lastly, we explored whether it is possible to identify best-indicator species based on their contribution to community variability using eigenvector decomposition methods Our results suggest that successfully identifying a best-indicator species for critical transitions in multispecies communities is not an easy task.},

Field experiments showed that nitrogen fertilization mitigates depletion stress and shifts plant growth from negative to positive in the center of patches. Hence, nutrient depletion plays an overriding role, as only this process can explain the concentric rings.

However, the lack of appropriate data and quantitative tools has hampered our understanding of the factors determining resilience on a global scale. Here, we quantified the temporal trends of two key components of resilience—­resistance and recovery—­in {\textgreater}2000 population time-­series of {\textgreater}1000 vertebrate species globally. We show that the number of threats to which a population is exposed is the main driver of resilience decline in vertebrate populations. Such declines are driven by a non-­uniform loss of different components of resilience (i.e. resistance and recovery). Increased anthropogenic threats accelerating resilience loss through a decline in the recovery ability—­but not resistance—­of vertebrate populations. These findings suggest we may be underestimating the impacts of global change, highlighting the need to account for the multiple components of resilience in global biodiversity assessments.},

We show theoretically and experimentally that catastrophic population extinctions themselves can promote metapopulation persistence, by preventing spatial synchrony and thus enhancing recolonization.

We refer to this behaviour as the ‘spatial hydra effect’: as with the mythical hydra that grows two new heads when one is removed, extinctions can increase recolonization
The effect is robust, occurring in a wide range of theoretical models exhibiting cyclic or quasi-cyclic population dynamics. In a laboratory microcosm experiment using cyclic protist predator–prey metapopulations, catastrophic perturbations wiping out populations but leaving the patch otherwise unchanged increased metapopulation persistence when high dispersal rates would otherwise have led to spatially synchronous extinctions of all populations. We discuss several candidate examples of the spatial hydra effect in nature.

	abstract = {Economic inequality is notoriously difficult to quantify as reliable data on household incomes are missing for most of the world. Here, we show that a proxy for inequality based on remotely sensed nighttime light data may help fill this gap. Individual households cannot be remotely sensed. However, as households tend to segregate into richer and poorer neighborhoods, the correlation between light emission and economic thriving shown in earlier studies suggests that spatial variance of remotely sensed light per person might carry a signal of economic inequality. To test this hypothesis, we quantified Gini coefficients of the spatial variation in average nighttime light emitted per person. We found a significant relationship between the resulting light-based inequality indicator and existing estimates of net income inequality. This correlation between light-based Gini coefficients and traditional estimates exists not only across countries, but also on a smaller spatial scale comparing the 50 states within the United States. The remotely sensed character makes it possible to produce high-resolution global maps of estimated inequality. The inequality proxy is entirely independent from traditional estimates as it is based on observed light emission rather than self-reported household incomes. Both are imperfect estimates of true inequality. However, their independent nature implies that the light-based proxy could be used to constrain uncertainty in traditional estimates. More importantly, the light-based Gini maps may provide an estimate of inequality where previously no data were available at all.},

Our framework integrates scale-­dependent feedback and density-­dependent movement into grazing ecosystems. This model derives six types of selective foraging behaviours that trigger pattern formation for top-­down grazing ecosystems, and one of which is consistent with existing foraging theories. Self-­organized patterns nucleate under moderate grazing intensity and are destroyed by overgrazing, which suggests ecosystem degradation. Theoretical results qualitatively agree with observed grazing ecosystems that display spatial heterogeneities under variable grazing intensity. Our findings potentially provide new insights into self-­organized patterns as an indicator of ecosystem transitions under a stressful environment.},

Resource-dependant foraging behaviour of herbivores is essential to the emergence of spatial heterogeneity in top-down grazing.

Difference with Turing pattern: The most intuitive and important hallmark of a phase-separation process is the coarsening of spatial patterns. Spatial vegetation patterns start with fine-grain then change over time toward a coarsegrain structure as adjacent patches merge to form larger patches, and this coarsening-like phenomenon has been reported in both grassland and salt marsh grazing ecosystems.

	abstract = {Increased reactive nitrogen (Nr) deposition has raised the amount of N available to organisms and has greatly altered the transfer of energy through food webs, with major consequences for trophic dynamics. The aim of this review was to: (i) clarify the direct and indirect effects of Nr deposition on forest and lake food webs in N-limited biomes, (ii) compare and contrast how aquatic and terrestrial systems respond to increased Nr deposition, and (iii) identify how the nutrient pathways within and between ecosystems change in response to Nr deposition. We present that Nr deposition releases primary producers from N limitation in both forest and lake ecosystems and raises plants’ N content which in turn beneﬁts herbivores with high N requirements. Such trophic effects are coupled with a general decrease in biodiversity caused by different N-use efﬁciencies; slow-growing species with low rates of N turnover are replaced by fast-growing species with high rates of N turnover. In contrast, Nr deposition diminishes below-ground production in forests, due to a range of mechanisms that reduce microbial biomass, and decreases lake benthic productivity by switching herbivore growth from N to phosphorus (P) limitation, and by intensifying P limitation of benthic ﬁsh. The ﬂow of nutrients between ecosystems is expected to change with increasing Nr deposition. Due to higher litter production and more intense precipitation, more terrestrial matter will enter lakes. This will beneﬁt bacteria and will in turn boost the microbial food web. Additionally, Nr deposition promotes emergent insects, which subsidize the terrestrial food web as prey for insectivores or by dying and decomposing on land. So far, most studies have examined Nr-deposition effects on the food web base, whereas our review highlights that changes at the base of food webs substantially impact higher trophic levels and therefore food web structure and functioning.},

We performed a ﬁeld experiment in which positive (microclimatic amelioration and water inputs from runoff) and negative (belowground competition) effects were experimentally manipulated under contrasting levels of stress. The environment provided by S. tenacissima (tussock treatment) improved the survival and physiological status of planted P. lentiscus seedlings. The elimination of shade and competition from S. tenacissima signiﬁcantly decreased and increased, respectively, seedling performance as compared to the tussock treatment. We found evidence that microclimatic amelioration is the main positive factor involved in the interaction under study, and that it can balance the negative effects of belowground competition. The latter was also important, especially after major rainfall events. In contrast with previous studies, both the water inputs from runoff and the soil chemical fertility were found to have a relatively weak effect in the interaction under study. The net effect of S. tenacissima on P. lentiscus was always facilitative, but the magnitude of this effect increased with the harshness of the environmental conditions in both space and time. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying plant–plant interaction responded unequally to small-scale environmental variation. Our results agree with models suggesting that the magnitude of facilitation may increase under stressful conditions, and provide evidence of the dynamic nature of positive and negative interactions in the ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Isolating the single effects and net balance of negative and positive species effects in complex interaction networks is a necessary step for understanding community dynamics. Facilitation and competition have both been found to operate in harsh environments, but their relative strength may be predicted to change along gradients of herbivory. Moreover, facilitation effects through habitat amelioration and protection from herbivory may act together determining the outcome of neighborhood plant–plant interactions. We tested the hypothesis that grazing pressure alters the balance of positive and negative interactions between palatable and unpalatable species by increasing the strength of positive indirect effects mediated by associational resistance to herbivory. We conducted a two-year factorial experiment in which distance (i.e., spatial association) from the nearest unpalatable neighbor (Stipa speciosa) and root competition were manipulated for two palatable grasses (Poa ligularis and Bromus pictus), at three levels of sheep grazing (none, moderate, and high) in a Patagonian steppe community. We found that grazing shifted the effect of Stipa on both palatable grasses, from negative (competition) in the absence of grazing to positive (facilitation) under increasing herbivore pressure. In ungrazed sites, belowground competition was the dominant interaction, as shown by a signiﬁcant reduction in performance of palatable grasses transplanted near to Stipa tussocks. In grazed sites, biomass of palatable plants was greater near than far from Stipa regardless of competition treatment. Proximity to Stipa reduced the amount of herbivory suffered by palatable grasses, an indirect effect that was stronger under moderate than under intense grazing. Our results demonstrate that facilitation, resulting mainly from protection against herbivory, is the overriding effect produced by unpalatable neighbors on palatable grasses in this rangeland community. This ﬁnding challenges the common view that abiotic stress amelioration should be the predominant type of facilitation in arid environments and highlights the role of herbivory in modulating complex neighborhood plant interactions in grazing systems.},

A predictive framework about the conditions under which such transitions occur is lacking. Here, we derive and analyze a general model describing the spatial dynamics of vegetation in arid ecosystems considering local facilitation as an essential process. We investigate the conditions under which continuous or discontinuous transitions from a vegetated to a desert state are likely to occur. We focus on arid ecosystems but our approach is sufﬁciently general to be applied to other ecosystems with severe environmental conditions. The model exhibits bistability and vegetation patchiness. High local facilitation decreases the risk of discontinuous transitions. Moreover, for arid ecosystems where local facilitation is a driving process, vegetation patchiness indicates proximity to a transition point, but does not allow distinguishing between continuous and discontinuous transitions.},

Results: In the absence of facilitation, species ranges only occurred within the limits of a triangular zone, which can be considered equivalent to Grime’s C-S-R triangle. Competitive species were distributed in low stress and disturbance conditions. Stress- and disturbance-tolerant species occurred in more stressed and disturbed environments. Species richness followed a hump-shaped relationship with a hotspot of diversity occurring close to the centre of the C-S-R triangle. In contrast, facilitation was able to dampen the negative impacts of stress and disturbance acting either solely or simultaneously, but this inﬂuence was not simply the sum of the effects of the processes operating independently on the two environmental gradients. Facilitation extended species distributions along both the stress and disturbance gradients and displaced the hotspot of diversity into the centre of the response surface.
Conclusions: Facilitation was able to promote the occurrence and persistence of communities in highly stressed and disturbed conditions, i.e. allowing a stable community to exist beyond the limits of the C-S-R triangle. We also showed that facilitation can be an important mechanism driving the displacement of hotspots of diversity from benign toward intermediate stressed and disturbed environments.},

For instance, species interactions are an important determinant of the complexity of changes in trophic biomass with variation in resources. Water resources are a major driver of terrestrial ecology and climate change is expected to greatly alter the distribution of this critical resource. While previous studies have documented strong effects of global environmental change on species interactions in general, responses can vary from region to region. Dryland ecosystems occupy more than one-third of the Earth’s land mass, are greatly affected by changes in water availability, and are predicted to be hotspots of climate change.

	abstract = {Plant–plant interactions are largely inﬂuenced by both environmental stress and ontogeny. Despite the effects of each of these factors on the overall outcome of these interactions has received considerable attention during the last years, the joint effects of both factors as drivers of such outcome are poorly understood. We used the combination of spatial pattern analysis, fruit production surveys, carbohydrate assays, sowing experiments and dendrochronological techniques to explore the interaction between Stipa tenacissima (nurse) and Lepidium subulatum (prote´ ge´ e) in two different slope aspects. This battery of techniques allows us to study the effects of the nurse plant during the whole life cycle of the prote´ ge´ e, and to assess the role of spatio-temporal variability in abiotic stress as a modulator of ontogenetic shifts in plant–plant interactions. Spatial pattern analyses suggested a net facilitative effect of S. tenacissima on L. subulatum. This effect was particularly important during the germination, shifting to competition (growth reduction) early after establishment. Competition was gradually reduced as the shrub aged, suggesting niche differentiation. The magnitude of competition was reduced under low rainfall levels in south-facing slopes, whereas this response was observed due to other abiotic factors in north-facing slopes. Our results highlight the crucial effect that positive interactions at early life-stages have to determine the long-term outcome of a given plant–plant interaction, and the existence of multiple shifts between facilitation and competition along different life-stages of the prote´ ge´ e. They also show how these ontogenetic shifts are modulated by abiotic factors, which differ among slope aspects. These ﬁndings may help to reﬁne conceptual and theoretical models about shifts between facilitation and ontogeny under current climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {Once seen as anomalous, facilitative interactions among plants and their importance for community structure and functioning are now widely recognized. The growing body of modelling, descriptive and experimental studies on facilitation covers a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic systems throughout the globe. However, the lack of a general body of theory linking facilitation among different types of organisms and biomes and their responses to environmental changes prevents further advances in our knowledge regarding the evolutionary and ecological implications of facilitation in plant communities. Moreover, insights gathered from alternative lines of inquiry may substantially improve our understanding of facilitation, but these have been largely neglected thus far. Despite over 15 years of research and debate on this topic, there is no consensus on the degree to which plant–plant interactions change predictably along environmental gradients (i.e. the stress-gradient hypothesis), and this hinders our ability to predict how plant–plant interactions may affect the response of plant communities to ongoing global environmental change. The existing controversies regarding the response of plant–plant interactions across environmental gradients can be reconciled when clearly considering and determining the species-specificity of the response, the functional or individual stress type, and the scale of interest (pairwise interactions or community-level response). Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to do this, supported by multiple lines of empirical evidence. We also discuss current gaps in our knowledge regarding how plant–plant interactions change along environmental gradients. These include the existence of thresholds in the amount of species-specific stress that a benefactor can alleviate, the linearity or non-linearity of the response of pairwise interactions across distance from the ecological optimum of the beneficiary, and the need to explore further how frequent interactions among multiple species are and how they change across different environments. We review the latest advances in these topics and provide new approaches to fill current gaps in our knowledge. We also apply our theoretical framework to advance our knowledge on the evolutionary aspects of plant facilitation, and the relative importance of facilitation, in comparison with other ecological processes, for maintaining ecosystem structure, functioning and dynamics. We build links between these topics and related fields, such as ecological restoration, woody encroachment, invasion ecology, ecological modelling and biodiversity–ecosystem-functioning relationships. By identifying commonalities and insights from alternative lines of research, we further advance our understanding of facilitation and provide testable hypotheses regarding the role of (positive) biotic interactions in the maintenance of biodiversity and the response of ecological communities to ongoing environmental changes.},

To do so, we coupled 14 years of temporal remote sensing measurements of plant biomass with field surveys of diversity in 123 dryland ecosystems from all continents except Antarctica. Across a wide range of climatic and soil conditions, plant species pools, and locations, we were able to explain 73\% of variation in ecosystem stability, measured as the ratio of the temporal mean biomass to the SD. The positive role of plant diversity on ecosystem stability was as important as that of climatic and soil factors. However, we also found a strong climate dependency of the biodiversity–ecosystem stability relationship across our global aridity gradient. Our findings suggest that the diversity of leaf traits may drive ecosystem stability at low aridity levels, whereas species richness may have a greater stabilizing role under the most arid conditions evaluated. Our study highlights that to minimize variations in the temporal delivery of ecosystem services related to plant biomass, functional and taxonomic plant diversity should be particularly promoted under low and high aridity conditions, respectively.},

We used two large data sets from drylands and agricultural grasslands to assess: (1) the generality of intransitive competition, (2) intransitivity–richness relationships and (3) effects of two major drivers of biodiversity loss (aridity and land-use intensiﬁcation) on intransitivity and species richness. Intransitive competition occurred in {\textgreater} 65\% of sites and was associated with higher species richness. Intransitivity increased with aridity, partly buffering its negative effects on diversity, but was decreased by intensive land use, enhancing its negative effects on diversity. These contrasting responses likely arise because intransitivity is promoted by temporal heterogeneity, which is enhanced by aridity but may decline with land-use intensity. We show that intransitivity is widespread in nature and increases diversity, but it can be lost with environmental homogenisation.},

Yet how traits should assemble to boost multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously (multifunctionality) remains poorly explored. In a multibiome litter experiment covering most of the global variation in leaf trait spectra, we showed that three dimensions of functional diversity (dispersion, rarity, and evenness) explained up to 66\% of variations in multifunctionality, although the dominant species and their traits remained an important predictor. While high dispersion impeded multifunctionality, increasing the evenness among functionally dissimilar species was a key dimension to promote higher multifunctionality and to reduce the abundance of plant pathogens. Because too-dissimilar species could have negative effects on ecosystems, our results highlight the need for not only diverse but also functionally even assemblages to promote multifunctionality. The effect of functionally rare species strongly shifted from positive to negative depending on their trait differences with the dominant species. Simultaneously managing the dispersion, evenness, and rarity in multispecies assemblages could be used to design assemblages aimed at maximizing multifunctionality independently of the biome, the identity of dominant species, or the range of trait values considered. Functional evenness and rarity offer promise to improve the management of terrestrial ecosystems and to limit plant disease risks.},

	abstract = {Over 65\% of drylands are used for grazing of managed livestock. Understanding what drives grazing effects on the structure and functioning of rangelands is critical for achieving their sustainability. We studied a network of 239 sites across Patagonian rangelands (Argentina), which constitute one of the world’s largest rangeland area. We aimed to (i) evaluate how aridity and grazing affect ecosystem structure and functioning and (ii) test the usefulness of the landscape function analysis (LFA) indices (stability, inﬁltration and nutrient cycling) as surrogates of soil functioning. Aridity decreased species richness and the cover of palatable grasses but increased the cover of palatable shrubs. Grazing pressure negatively impacted the cover of palatable grasses and species richness but did not affect the cover of shrubs. Aridity had direct and indirect negative relationships with the LFA indices. Grazing pressure had no direct effects on the LFA indices but had an indirect negative effect on them by affecting vegetation structure. The LFA indices were positively and negatively correlated with soil organic carbon and sand contents, respectively, suggesting that these indices are useful proxies of soil functional processes in Patagonian rangelands. Our ﬁndings indicate that aridity and overgrazing have convergent effects on the structure and functioning of ecosystems, as both promoted reductions in species richness, the cover of palatable grasses and soil functioning. Rangeland management activities should aim to enhance species richness and the cover of palatable grasses, as these actions could contribute to offset adverse effects of ongoing increases in aridity on drylands.

	abstract = {Recently, numerous studies have pointed to the importance of positive interactions in natural communities. There is now a broad consensus that the balance between negative and positive interactions should shift along environmental gradients, with competition prevailing under environmentally benign conditions and positive interactions dominating under harsh conditions. A commonly cited example of the importance of facilitation in harsh environments is the preference of desert annual plants for the areas under the canopy of shrubs. The recognition of apparently positive effects of desert shrubs on annuals, however, has been mostly based on density measurements, while ﬁtness parameters of the understory plants have been ignored. Also, the temporal consistency of such effects has not been previously tested. Based on conceptual ideas about the balance between interference and facilitation, we predicted that positive effects of the shrubs on the understory should dominate in dry years, while in favorable years, negative effects would be stronger. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the direction and magnitude of the shrub effect on demographic responses of four desert annual plant species during four consecutive seasons of differing rainfall. The results contradicted our initial hypothesis. Depending on the species, the effect of the shrubs shifted from either negative to neutral or from neutral to positive with increasing annual rainfall. However, this trend was stronger for the effect of shrubs on plant reproductive success than on their densities. Our data highlight the importance of measuring ﬁtness parameters in studies of plant–plant interactions. We suggest that the negative effects of shrubs on plant ﬁtness were due to rainfall interception, while positive effects were related to increased nutrient availability beneath shrubs. However, the mechanisms by which the shrubs and annuals interact can only be resolved using an experimental approach. Our results contradict previous hypotheses about the relative importance of positive and negative interactions along environmental gradients. A simple conceptual model summarizing the proposed role of rainfall in determining the direction of shrub effects on their understory annuals is presented.},

	abstract = {Summary 1 Theoretical models have predicted that the relative importance of facilitation and competition will vary inversely across gradients of abiotic stress, with facilitation being the dominant interaction under high abiotic stress conditions. A critical reappraisal of current theoretical models is needed because experimental studies both support and refute their predictions. 2 A quantitative meta-analysis of field and common garden studies evaluating the effect of abiotic stress (low vs. high) on the net outcome of plant?plant interactions in arid and semi-arid environments was performed to evaluate the degree of empirical support for these models. We created four separate data sets corresponding to the categories of response variables commonly used to measure plant performance (survival, density, growth and fecundity). 3 The analyses showed that both the selection of the estimator of plant performance and the experimental approach followed have a strong influence on both the net outcome of plant?plant interactions and the effect of abiotic stress on such outcome. The effect of neighbours on the survival and growth of target plants was not significant at either stress level, but that on the density and fecundity of target plants was positive (facilitation) and negative (competition) at the low and high abiotic stress level, respectively. Density data showed that the net effect of neighbours was positive and negative at low and high abiotic stress levels, respectively, whereas other estimators suggested that the net effect of neighbours did not differ with stress level. None of our meta-analyses indicated that the magnitude of the net effect provided by neighbours, whether positive or negative, was higher under high abiotic stress conditions, and facilitation does not therefore appear to increase in importance with abiotic stress. 4 As the predictions of current theoretical models regarding the relationship between the net outcome of a plant?plant interaction and abiotic stress do not hold in arid and semi-arid environments, different models are needed. These should consider different sources of abiotic stress separately, and should be valid for performance measurements, such as survival, that integrate plant responses over time. The incorporation of these features into theoretical models will undoubtedly improve their predictive capabilities.},

While abiotic stress profoundly affects biotic interactions, their potential role as modulators of ecosystem responses to climate change is largely unknown. Using plants and biological soil crusts, we tested the relative importance of facilitative–competitive interactions and other community attributes (cover, species richness and species evenness) as drivers of ecosystem functioning along stress gradients in semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystems. Biotic interactions shifted from facilitation to competition along stress gradients driven by water availability and temperature. These changes were, however, dependent on the spatial scale and the community considered. We found little evidence to suggest that biotic interactions are a major direct influence upon indicators of ecosystem functioning (soil respiration, organic carbon, water-holding capacity, compaction and the activity of enzymes related to the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles) along stress gradients. However, attributes such as cover and species richness showed a direct effect on ecosystem functioning. Our results do not agree with predictions emphasizing that the importance of plant–plant interactions will be increased under climate change in dry environments, and indicate that reductions in the cover of plant and biological soil crust communities will negatively impact ecosystems under future climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Studies of facilitative interactions as drivers of plant richness along environmental gradients often assume the existence of an overarching stress gradient that equally affects the performance of all the species in a given community. However, co-existing species differ in their ecophysiological adaptations, and do not experience the same stress level under particular environmental conditions. Moreover, these studies assume a unimodal relationship between richness and biomass, which is not as general as previously thought. We ignored these assumptions to assess changes in plant–plant interactions and their effect on local species richness across environmental gradients in semi-arid areas of Spain and Australia. We aimed to understand the relative importance of direct (microhabitat amelioration) and indirect (changes in the competitive relationships among the understorey species: niche segregation, competitive exclusion or intransitivity) mechanisms that might underlie the effects of nurse plants on local species richness. By jointly studying these direct and indirect mechanisms using a unifying framework, we found that nurse plants (trees, shrubs and tussock grasses) increased local richness not only by expanding the niche of neighbouring species but also by increasing niche segregation among them, though the latter was not important in all cases. The outcome of the competition-facilitation continuum varied depending on the study area, likely because the different types of stress gradient considered. When driven by both rainfall and temperature, or rainfall alone, the community-wide importance of nurse plants remained constant (Spanish sites), or showed a unimodal relationship along the gradient (Australian sites). This study expands our understanding of the relative roles of plant–plant interactions and environmental conditions as drivers of local species richness in semi-arid environments. The results can also be used to reﬁne predictions about the response of plant communities to environmental change, and to clarify the relative importance of biotic interactions as drivers of such responses.},

	abstract = {Dryland ecosystems are likely to respond discontinuously to gradual changes in environmental conditions. Direct facilitation between plants, whereby plants improve the local environmental conditions for others, has been shown to be a mechanism contributing to these discontinuous ecosystem transitions. Theoretical models describing dryland vegetation dynamics often consider a single plant species and one type of facilitation, namely direct facilitation. However, another type of facilitation–indirect facilitation–is widespread in dryland ecosystems as well; it is performed by plants protected against grazing, the nurses, when this protection extends to other plants growing in their neighbourhood that are deprived of such protection, the protegees. Little is known about the long-term effects of indirect facilitation on dryland dynamics. Here, we developed and analysed a theoretical model including two species–a nurse and a protegee–and indirect facilitation through grazing. We investigated the effects of indirect facilitation on species composition, species spatial clustering and the stability of dryland ecosystems. We showed that indirect facilitation through grazing enables the stable coexistence of the nurse and the protegee and allows the reversibility of the protegee extinction. Surprisingly, the strength of indirect facilitation affected neither the total nor the interspecific vegetation clustering. Our study highlights that spatially explicit grazing protection may affect species composition and the stability of dryland ecosystems and gives hints about how species interactions translate into spatial clustering.},

	abstract = {Positive interspecific interactions are commonplace, and in recent years ecologists have begun to realize how important they can be in determining community and ecosystem dynamics. It has been predicted that net positive interactions are likely to occur in environments characterized by high abiotic stress. Although empirical field studies have started to support these predictions, little theoretical work has been carried out on the dynamic nature of these effects and their consequences for community structure. We use a simple patch-occupancy model to simulate the dynamics of a pair of species living on an environmental gradient. Each of the species can exist as either a mutualist or a cheater. The results confirm the prediction: a band of mutualists tends to occur in environmental conditions beyond the limits of the cheaters. The region between mutualists and cheaters is interesting: population density here is low. Mutualists periodically occupy this area, but are displaced by cheaters, who themselves go extinct in the absence of the mutualists. Furthermore, the existence of mutualists extends the area occupied by the cheaters, essentially increasing their realized niche. Our approach has considerable potential for improving our understanding of the balance between positive and negative interspecific interactions and for predicting the probable impacts of habitat loss and climate change on communities dominated by positive interspecific interactions.},

	abstract = {Restoration has been elevated as an important strategy to reverse the decline of coastal wetlands worldwide. Current practice in restoration science emphasizes minimizing competition between out-planted propagules to maximize planting success. This paradigm persists despite the fact that foundational theory in ecology demonstrates that positive species interactions are key to organism success under high physical stress, such as recolonization of bare substrate. As evidence of how entrenched this restoration paradigm is, our survey of 25 restoration organizations in 14 states in the United States revealed that {\textgreater}95\% of these agencies assume minimizing negative interactions (i.e., competition) between outplants will maximize propagule growth. Restoration experiments in both Western and Eastern Atlantic salt marshes demonstrate, however, that a simple change in planting configuration (placing propagules next to, rather than at a distance from, each other) results in harnessing facilitation and increased yields by 107\% on average. Thus, small adjustments in restoration design may catalyze untapped positive species interactions, resulting in significantly higher restoration success with no added cost. As positive interactions between organisms commonly occur in coastal ecosystems (especially in more physically stressful areas like uncolonized substrate) and conservation resources are limited, transformation of the coastal restoration paradigm to incorporate facilitation theory may enhance conservation efforts, shoreline defense, and provisioning of ecosystem services such as fisheries production.},

	abstract = {Abstract To understand ecosystems, an integrative approach combining functional ecology and community ecology is required. Nutrient cycling is a good example since it links each organism to the major flows of materials in ecosystems. Together with the demographic processes governing the mortality of organisms (and hence their nutrient losses) such as self-regulation, nutrient recycling has a major impact on ecosystem dynamics and stability. By considering stochastic perturbations in the vicinity of the equilibrium affecting the top species in a food chain, we assessed stability based on the temporal variability in the different compartments of the food chain for different recycling efficiencies and self-regulation intensities. Our results show that nutrient cycling always has a destabilising effect on perturbed species, while lower trophic levels are stabilised or destabilised depending on their trophic distance from the perturbed species. Thus, for species at odd distances from the top species, nutrient cycling is stabilising, whereas for species at even distances, nutrient cycling is destabilising. Self-regulation generally stabilises systems, unless its effects are too strong. Finally, nutrient cycling and self-regulation have opposite effects because nutrient cycling dampens the stabilising effect of self-regulation. Considering these two phenomena together is necessary to assess the effects of perturbations on species dynamics and thus to understand the overall response of ecosystems in the context of global changes.

	abstract = {Land degradation is a problem proliﬁc across semi-arid areas worldwide. Despite being a complex process including both biotic and abiotic elements, previous attempts to understand ecosystem dynamics have largely been carried out within the disparate disciplines of ecology and hydrology, which has led to signiﬁcant limitations. Here, an ecohydrological framework is outlined, to provide a new direction for the study of land degradation in semi-arid ecosystems. Unlike other frameworks that draw upon hierarchy theory to provide a broad, non-explicit conceptual framework, this new framework is based upon the explicit linkage of processes operating over the continuum of temporal and spatial scales by perceiving the ecosystem as a series of structural and functional connections, within which interactions between biotic and abiotic components of the landscape occur. It is hypothesized that semi-arid land degradation conforms to a cusp-catastrophe model in which the two controlling variables are abiotic structural connectivity and abiotic functional connectivity, which implicitly account for ecosystem resilience, and biotic structural and function connectivity. It is suggested therefore that future research must (1) evaluate how abiotic and biotic function (i.e. water, sediment and nutrient loss/redistribution) vary over grass–shrub transitions and (2) quantify the biotic/abiotic structure over grass-shrub transitions, to (3) determine the interactions between ecosystem structure and function, and interactions/feedbacks between biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem.

Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2–6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships.

Today, evidence indicates that evolution can operate over a range of spatial scales, including fine spatial scales. Thus, evolutionary divergence across space might frequently interact with the mechanisms that also determine spatial ecological patterns. Here, we synthesize insights from 500 eco-evolutionary studies and develop a predictive framework that seeks to understand whether and when evolution amplifies, dampens, or creates ecological patterns. We demonstrate that local adaptation can alter everything from spatial variation in population abundances to ecosystem properties. We uncover 14 mechanisms that can mediate the outcome of evolution on spatial ecological patterns. Sometimes, evolution amplifies environmental variation, especially when selection enhances resource uptake or patch selection. The local evolution of foundation or keystone species can create ecological patterns where none existed originally. However, most often, we find that evolution dampens existing environmental gradients, because local adaptation evens out fitness across environments and thus counteracts the variation in associated ecological patterns. Consequently, evolution generally smooths out the underlying heterogeneity in nature, making the world appear less ragged than it would be in the absence of evolution. We end by highlighting the future research needed to inform a fully integrated and predictive biology that accounts for eco-evolutionary interactions in both space and time.},

	abstract = {Complex natural systems with eroded resilience, such as populations, ecosystems and socio-ecological systems, respond to small perturbations with abrupt, discontinuous state shifts, or critical transitions. Theory of critical transitions suggests that such systems exhibit fold bifurcations featuring folded response curves, tipping points and alternate attractors. However, there is little empirical evidence of fold bifurcations occurring in actual complex natural systems impacted by multiple stressors. Moreover, resilience of complex systems to change currently lacks clear operational measures with generic application. Here, we provide empirical evidence for the occurrence of a fold bifurcation in an exploited ﬁsh population and introduce a generic measure of ecological resilience based on the observed fold bifurcation attributes. We analyse the multivariate development of Barents Sea cod (Gadus morhua), which is currently the world’s largest cod stock, over six decades (1949–2009), and identify a population state shift in 1981. By plotting a multivariate population index against a multivariate stressor index, the shift mechanism was revealed suggesting that the observed population shift was a nonlinear response to the combined effects of overﬁshing and climate change. Annual resilience values were estimated based on the position of each year in relation to the ﬁtted attractors and assumed tipping points of the fold bifurcation. By interpolating the annual resilience values, a folded stability landscape was ﬁt, which was shaped as predicted by theory. The resilience assessment suggested that the population may be close to another tipping point. This study illustrates how a multivariate analysis, supported by theory of critical transitions and accompanied by a quantitative resilience assessment, can clarify shift mechanisms in data-rich complex natural systems.},

	abstract = {Ecological resilience is the ability of a system to persist in the face of perturbations. Although resilience has been a highly inﬂuential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A ﬁrst set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural ﬂuctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the systemspeciﬁc knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems.},

Despite decades of research, controversy has emerged as to whether positive and negative interactions predictably shift with increasing environmental stress as hypothesised by the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH). Here, we provide a synthesis of 727 tests of the SGH in plant communities across the globe to examine its generality across a variety of ecological factors. Our results show that plant interactions change with stress through an outright shift to facilitation (survival) or a reduction in competition (growth and reproduction). In a limited number of cases, plant interactions do not respond to stress, but they never shift towards competition with stress. These ﬁndings are consistent across stress types, plant growth forms, life histories, origins (invasive vs. native), climates, ecosystems and methodologies, though the magnitude of the shifts towards facilitation with stress is dependent on these factors. We suggest that future studies should employ standardised deﬁnitions and protocols to test the SGH, take a multi-factorial approach that considers variables such as plant traits in addition to stress, and apply the SGH to better understand how species and communities will respond to environmental change.},

In this study we assessed the relative effect of grazing pressure and slope aspect (drought stress) on vegetation cover and soil functioning in semi-arid Mediterranean grasslandeshrublands in southeastern Spain. Moreover, we linked these two stress factors to plant co-occurrence patterns at species-pair and community levels, by performing C-score analyses. Vegetation cover and soil functioning decreased with higher grazing pressure and more south-facing (drier) slopes. At the community level, plants at south-facing slopes were negatively associated at no grazing but positively associated at low grazing pressure and randomly associated at high grazing pressure. At north-facing slopes, grazing did not result in a shift in the direction of the association. In contrast, analysis of pairwise species co-occurrence patterns showed that the dominant species Stipa tenacissima and Anthyllis cytisoides shifted from excluding each other to cooccurring with increasing grazing pressure at north-facing slopes. Our ﬁndings highlight that for improved understanding of plant interactions along stress gradients, interactions between species pairs and interactions at the community level should be assessed, as these may reveal contrasting results.},

Anticipating these critical transitions remains challenging in systems with many species because the associated early warning signals can be weakly present or even absent in some species, depending on the system dynamics. Therefore, our limited knowledge of ecological dynamics may suggest that it is hard to identify those species in the system that display early warning signals. Here, we show that, in mutualistic ecological systems, it is possible to identify species that early anticipate critical transitions by knowing only the system structure—that is, the network topology of plant–animal interactions. Specifically, we leverage the mathematical theory of structural observability of dynamical systems to identify a minimum set of “sensor species,” whose measurement guarantees that we can infer changes in the abundance of all other species. Importantly, such a minimum set of sensor species can be identified by using the system structure only. We analyzed the performance of such minimum sets of sensor species for detecting early warnings using a large dataset of empirical plant–pollinator and seed-dispersal networks. We found that species that are more likely to be sensors tend to anticipate earlier critical transitions than other species. Our results underscore how knowing the structure of multispecies systems can improve our ability to anticipate critical transitions.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the positive correlation between stability and resilience, as the essential assumption of indicators based on critical slowing down, can break down in this system when multiple environmental drivers are changed simultaneously.

          Abstract
          Ecosystems worldwide receive large amounts of nutrients from both natural processes and human activities. While direct subsidy effects on primary productivity are relatively well known (the green food web), the indirect effects of subsidies on producers as mediated by the brown food web and predators have been neglected. With a dynamical green-brown food web model, parameterized using empirical estimates from the literature, we illustrate the effect of nutrient subsidies on net primary productivity (i.e., after removing loss to herbivory) in two generic ecosystems, terrestrial and aquatic. We find that nutrient subsidies increase net primary productivity because more nutrients are available, but this effect saturates with higher subsidies. Changing the quality of subsidies from inorganic to organic tends to increase net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems, but less often so in aquatic ecosystems. This occurs when organic nutrient inputs promote detritivores in the brown food web, and hence predators that in turn control herbivores, thus promoting primary productivity. This previously largely overlooked effect is further enhanced by ecosystem properties such as fast decomposition and low rates of nutrient additions, and demonstrates the importance of nutrient subsidy quality on ecosystem functioning.},

These mechanisms of coexistence can further interact with meta-ecosystem effects, which results in spatial heterogeneity through the movement of herbivores and nutrients. Here, we investigate how herbivores influence autotroph coexistence through a meta-ecosystem effect, and how this effect couples mechanisms of coexistence to ecosystem structure and functioning. We articulate this framework through a parameterized one resource-k producer–one herbivore meta-ecosystem model. The results show that herbivore movement with nutrient recycling can generate spatial heterogeneity to allow coexistence where the wellmixed system predicts competitive exclusion. Furthermore, the presence of movement alters local and regional ecosystem functioning even when coexistence would occur without movement.

Mobile organisms, however, commonly drive nutrient flows across ecosystems through nutrient recycling. Using a meta-­ecosystem model where consumers move between ecosystems, we study how consumer recycling and traits related to feeding and sheltering preferences affect species diversity and trophic regulation. We show local effects of recycling can cascade across space, yielding spatially heterogeneous top-­down and bottom-­up effects. Consumer traits impact the direction and magnitude of these effects by enabling recycling to favour a single ecosystem. Recycling further modifies outcomes of competition between consumer species by creating a positive feedback on the production of one competitor.

As with other interactions, the structure of dispersal can affect the stability of a system. However, the primary structure that has been studied in consumer-resource models has been hierarchical dispersal, where between-patch dispersal rates increase with trophic level. Here we use analytical, numerical, and simulation approaches on a two-patch, three-species metacommunity model to investigate the relationship between structure and community stability and resilience. We show that metacommunity stability is greater in systems with both weak and strong dispersal rates. Our system is stabilized by the formation of patterns when predators disperse frequently and herbivores disperse rarely, and via asynchrony when both predators and herbivores disperse infrequently.

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to the study of food webs emphasize the transfer of local primary productivity in the form of living plant organic matter across trophic levels. However, dead organic matter, or detritus, a common feature of most ecosystems plays a frequently overlooked role as a dynamic heterogeneous resource and habitat for many species. We develop an integrative framework for understanding the impact of detritus that emphasizes the ontogeny and heterogeneity of detritus and the various ways that explicit inclusion of detrital dynamics alters generalizations about the structure and functioning of food webs. Through its inﬂuences on food web composition and dynamics, detritus often increases system stability and persistence, having substantial effects on trophic structure and biodiversity. Inclusion of detrital heterogeneity in models of food web dynamics is an essential new direction for ecological research.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems comprise living organisms and organic matter or detritus. In earlier community ecology theories, ecosystem dynamics were normally understood in terms of aboveground, green-world trophic interaction networks, or food webs. Recently, there has been growing interest in the role played in ecosystem dynamics by detritus in underground, brown-world interactions. However, the role of decomposers in the consumption of detritus to produce nutrients in ecosystem dynamics remains unclear. Here, an ecosystem model of trophic food chains, detritus, decomposers, and decomposer predators demonstrated that decomposers play a totally different role than that previously predicted, with regard to their relationship between nutrient cycling and ecosystem stability. The high flux of nutrients due to efficient decomposition by decomposers increases ecosystem stability. However, moderate levels of ecosystem openness (with movement of materials) can either greatly increase or decrease ecosystem stability. Furthermore, the stability of an ecosystem peaks at intermediate openness because open systems are less stable than closed systems. These findings suggest that decomposers and the food-web dynamics of brown-world interactions are crucial for ecosystem stability, and that the properties of decomposition rate and openness are important in predicting changes in ecosystem stability in response to changes in decomposition efficiency driven by climate change.},

	abstract = {Animal movements are important drivers of nutrient redistribution that can affect primary productivity and biodiversity across various spatial scales. Recent work indicates that incorporating these movements into ecosystem models can enhance our ability to predict the spatio-temporal distribution of nutrients. However, the role of animal behaviour in animal-mediated nutrient transport (i.e. active subsidies) remains under-explored. Here we review the current literature on active subsidies to show how the behaviour of active subsidy agents makes them both ecologically important and qualitatively distinct from abiotic processes (i.e. passive subsidies). We ﬁrst propose that animal movement patterns can create similar ecological effects (i.e. press and pulse disturbances) in recipient ecosystems, which can be equal in magnitude to or greater than those of passive subsidies. We then highlight three key behavioural features distinguishing active subsidies. First, organisms can transport nutrients counter-directionally to abiotic forces and potential energy gradients (e.g. upstream). Second, unlike passive subsidies, organisms respond to the patterns of nutrients that they generate. Third, animal agents interact with each other. The latter two features can form positive- or negative-feedback loops, creating patterns in space or time that can reinforce nutrient hotspots in places of mass aggregations and/or create lasting impacts within ecosystems. Because human-driven changes can affect both the space-use of active subsidy species and their composition at both population (i.e. individual variation) and community levels (i.e. species interactions), predicting patterns in nutrient ﬂows under future modiﬁed environmental conditions depends on understanding the behavioural mechanisms that underlie active subsidies and variation among agents’ contributions. We conclude by advocating for the integration of animal behaviour, animal movement data, and individual variation into future conservation efforts in order to provide more accurate and realistic assessments of changing ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Numerous biotic mechanisms can control ecosystem nutrient cycling, but their full incorporation into ecological models or experimental designs can result in inordinate complexity. Including organismal nutrient limitation in models of highly dimensional systems (i.e., those with many nutrient pools/species) presents a critical challenge. We evaluate the importance of explicitly considering microbial and animal nutrient limitation to predict ecosystem nitrogen cycling across plant-based and detritus-based food chains. We investigate how eight factorial scenarios of microbial, herbivore, and microbi-detritivore (i.e., omnivores consuming microbes and detritus) nitrogen or carbon limitation alter the stocks and flows of nitrogen in an ecosystem model. We used a combination of partial derivatives of model equilibrium solutions and numerical simulations using randomly drawn parameter sets to explore the impact of each nutrient limitation scenario on nutrient stocks and flows. We show that switching microbes, herbivores, or microbi-detritivores from nitrogen to carbon limitation consistently altered the ecosystem response to changes in inorganic nitrogen supply, plant C:N ratio, and microbial C:N ratio. Organism nutrient limitation changed ecosystem nitrogen flows by altering the feedbacks between the abiotic and biotic pools. For example, microbi-detritivore nutrient limitation determined whether the microbial response to changes in inorganic nitrogen supply and C:N ratios was dependent on the size of detrital carbon or detrital nitrogen pool. Such correlated responses among biotic and abiotic pools set up a network of predictable changes in ecosystem properties sensitive to organism nutrient limitation. Scenarios with microbial limitation were generally sufficient to capture the suite of ecosystem responses to increasing inorganic nitrogen supply, while scenarios with animal limitation added new behavior whenever C:N ratios changed. We make the case for explicitly considering both microbial and animal nutrient limitation when predicting the flow and distribution of nitrogen across green and brown food chains.},

	abstract = {Plant introductions and subsequent community shifts are known to affect nutrient cycling, but most such studies have focused on nutrient enrichment effects. The nature of plant-driven nutrient depletions and the mechanisms by which these might occur are relatively poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that the proliferation of the commonly introduced coconut palm,
              Cocos nucifera
              , interrupts the flow of allochthonous marine subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems via an indirect effect: impact on birds. Birds avoid nesting or roosting in
              C. nucifera
              , thus reducing the critical nutrient inputs they bring from the marine environment. These decreases in marine subsidies then lead to reductions in available soil nutrients, decreases in leaf nutrient quality, diminished leaf palatability, and reduced herbivory.  This nutrient depletion pathway contrasts the more typical patterns of nutrient enrichment that follow plant species introductions. Research on the effects of spatial subsidy disruptions on ecosystems has not yet examined interruptions driven by changes within the recipient community, such as plant community shifts. The ubiquity of coconut palm introductions across the tropics and subtropics makes these observations particularly noteworthy. Equally important, the case of
              C. nucifera
              provides a strong demonstration of how plant community changes can dramatically impact the supply of allochthonous nutrients and thereby reshape energy flow in ecosystems.},

Historically, resilience has been deﬁned via models that do not take spatial effects into account. These systems can only adapt via uniform adjustments. In reality, however, the response is not necessarily uniform, and can lead to the formation of (self-organised) spatial patterns – typically localised vegetation patches. Classical measures of resilience cannot capture the emerging dynamics in spatially self-organised systems, including transitions between patterned states that have limited impact on ecosystem structure and productivity. We present a framework of interlinked phase portraits that appropriately quantiﬁes the resilience of patterned states, which depends on the number of patches, the distances between them and environmental conditions. We show how classical resilience concepts fail to distinguish between small and large pattern transitions, and ﬁnd that the variance in interpatch distances provides a suitable indicator for the type of imminent transition. Subsequently, we describe the dependency of ecosystem degradation based on the rate of climatic change: slow change leads to sporadic, large transitions, whereas fast change causes a rapid sequence of smaller transitions. Finally, we discuss how pre-emptive removal of patches can minimise productivity losses during pattern transitions, constituting a viable conservation strategy.},

This insight is based on studies of reaction–diffusion models that reproduce visual characteristics of vegetation patterns observed on aerial photographs. However, until now, the development of reliable early warning systems has been hampered by the lack of more in-depth comparisons between model predictions and real ecosystem patterns. In this paper, we combined topographical data, (remotely sensed) optical data, and in situ biomass measurements from two sites in Somalia to generate a multilevel description of dryland vegetation patterns. We performed an in-depth comparison between these observed vegetation pattern characteristics and predictions made by the extended-Klausmeier model for dryland vegetation patterning. Consistent with model predictions, we found that for a given topography, there is multistability of ecosystem states with different pattern wavenumbers. Furthermore, observations corroborated model predictions regarding the relationships between pattern wavenumber, total biomass, and maximum biomass. In contrast, model predictions regarding the role of slope angles were not corroborated by the empirical data, suggesting that inclusion of small-scale topographical heterogeneity is a promising avenue for future model development. Our findings suggest that patterned dryland ecosystems may be more resilient to environmental change than previously anticipated, but this enhanced resilience crucially depends on the adaptive capacity of vegetation patterns.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in food-web ecology highlight that most real food webs (1) represent an interplay between producer- and detritus-based webs and (2) are governed by consumers which are rampant omnivores; feeding on varied prey across trophic levels and resource channels. A possible avenue to unify these advances comes from models demonstrating that predators feeding on distinctly different channels may stabilize food webs. Empirical studies suggest many consumers engage in such behavior by feeding on prey items from both living-autotroph (green) and detritus-based (brown) webs, what we term ‘‘multichannel feeding,’’ yet we know little about how common such feeding is across systems and trophic levels, or its effect on system stability. Considering 23 empirical webs, we ﬁnd that multichannel feeding is equally common across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, with .50\% of consumers classiﬁed as multichannel consumers. Multichannel feeding occurred most often at the ﬁrst consumer level, indicating that most taxa at the herbivore/detritivore level are more aptly described as multichannel consumers, and that such feeding is not restricted to predators. We next developed a simple four-compartment nutrient cycling model for consumers eating both autotrophs and detritus with separate parameter sets to represent aquatic vs. terrestrial ecosystems. Modeling results showed that, across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, multichannel feeding is stabilizing at low attack rates on autotrophs or when attack rates are asymmetric (moderate on autotrophs while low on detritus), but destabilizing at high attack rates on autotrophs, compared to herbivory- or detritivory-only models. The set of conditions with stable webs with multichannel consumers is narrower, however, for aquatic systems, suggesting that multichannel feeding may generally be more stabilizing in terrestrial systems. Together, our results demonstrate that multichannel feeding is common across ecosystems and may be a stabilizing force in real webs that have consumers with low or asymmetric attack rates.},

	abstract = {We introduce a spatially explicit model that evaluates how the trade-offs between the life strategies of two interacting plant species affect the outcome of their interaction along environmental severity gradients. In our model, we represent the landscape as a two-dimensional lattice, with environmental severity increasing from left to right. Two species with different strategies, a competitor and a stresstolerant, interact in the lattice. We ﬁnd that facilitation expands the realized niche of the competitor into harsh environments by suppressing the stress-tolerant species. Most of their coexisting range is dominated by a positive effect of one species on another, with a reciprocal negative effect from the species receiving the beneﬁts on its benefactor (‘‘+, À’’), whereas mutualistic (‘‘+, +’’) interactions are only found in the harshest part of the environmental gradient. Contrarily as assumed by models commonly used in facilitation research (e.g. dual-lattice models), our results indicate that ‘‘+, +’’ interactions are not dominant, and that their differences with ‘‘+, À’’ interactions along environmental severity gradients depend on the strategies of the interacting species. By integrating the trade-off between competitive ability and stress tolerance, our model provides a new framework to investigate the interplay of facilitative and competitive interactions along environmental gradients and their impacts on processes such as population dynamics and community organization.},

It plays a prominent role in aquatic ecosystems, and it is crucial to functions from nutrient cycling to energy transfer in food webs. Coastal and estuarine ecosystem structure and function are strongly affected by anthropogenic pressures; however, there are large gaps in our understanding of the responses of inorganic nutrient and organic matter ﬂuxes between benthic habitats and the water column. We illustrate the varied nature of physical and biological benthic–pelagic coupling processes and their potential sensitivity to three anthropogenic pressures – climate change, nutrient loading, and ﬁshing – using the Baltic Sea as a case study and summarize current knowledge on the exchange of inorganic nutrients and organic material between habitats. Traditionally measured benthic–pelagic coupling processes (e.g., nutrient exchange and sedimentation of organic material) are to some extent quantiﬁable, but the magnitude and variability of biological processes are rarely assessed, preventing quantitative comparisons. Changing oxygen conditions will continue to have widespread effects on the processes that govern inorganic and organic matter exchange among habitats while climate change and nutrient load reductions may have large effects on organic matter sedimentation. Many biological processes (predation, bioturbation) are expected to be sensitive to anthropogenic drivers, but the outcomes for ecosystem function are largely unknown. We emphasize how improved empirical and experimental understanding of benthic–pelagic coupling processes and their variability are necessary to inform models that can quantify the feedbacks among processes and ecosystem responses to a changing world.},

We investigate whether this positive feedback and the spatial redistribution of runoff water are sufﬁcient to explain vegetation pattern formation. For this purpose, we analyze a spatially explicit model consisting of partial differential equations using a method for demonstrating pattern formation (Turing analysis). Our analysis reveals that pattern formation can occur in semi-arid areas given only the positive feedback between plant density and local water inﬁltration coupled with the spatial redistribution of runoff water. Thus, slope and underlying heterogeneity are not essential conditions. Other factors in the model, such as herbivory, plant dispersal, rainfall, and drought tolerance of plants, appear to determine under what conditions pattern formation is likely but are not the primary factors that generate the patterns. The model is in agreement with ﬁeld observations and indicates the conditions for which vegetation pattern formation can be expected in arid and semi-arid grazing systems.},

These inputs can alter consumption rates of consumer and predator species in the recipient food webs, thereby inﬂuencing food web stability. Starting from a well-studied tritrophic food chain model, we investigated the impact of allochthonous inputs on the stability of a simple food web model. We considered the effects of allochthonous inputs on stability of the model using four sets of biologically plausible parameters that represent different dynamical outcomes. We found that low levels of allochthonous inputs stabilize food web dynamics when species preferentially feed on the autochthonous sources, while either increasing the input level or changing the feeding preference to favor allochthonous inputs, or both, led to a decoupling of the food chain that could result in the loss of one or all species. We argue that allochthonous inputs are important sources of productivity in many food webs and their inﬂuence needs to be studied further. This is especially important in the various systems, such as caves, headwater streams, and some small marine islands, in which more energy enters the food web from allochthonous inputs than from autochthonous inputs.},

They are indirect mutualists through nutrient cycling, but also competitors for inorganic nutrients due to stoichiometric constraints in decomposers. We examine the conditions under which they are able to coexist, and hence ecosystems are able to persist, using a stoichiometrically explicit minimum model for an ecosystem. The model takes into account the coupling of carbon and a nutrient in the biomass and detritus, the nutrient limitation and the energy-providing role of primary producers, the recycling role of decomposers, and the stoichiometric constraints leading to indirect competition for the nutrient. The model shows that two conditions must be met to ensure coexistence of primary producers and decomposers: (1) decomposers must be limited by the carbon provided by plant detritus, and (2) the difference between the carbon : nutrient ratios of primary producers and decomposers must be sufﬁciently small. Condition (1) is fulﬁlled if decomposers are better competitors than primary producers for nutrient uptake. When nutrient uptake by plants and decomposers has a Lotka-Volterra form, these results are robust whether the nutrient cycle is closed or open. When nutrient uptake is donor controlled, however, coexistence is facilitated by an open nutrient cycle. We conclude that ecosystem persistence is not a trivial issue when stoichiometry is taken into account in ecological processes. Strict conditions on the carbon : nutrient ratios and competitive abilities of plants and microorganisms may be required. Given these theoretical results, we highlight the lack of experimental data concerning primary producer and decomposer coexistence conditions, and we suggest that more research has to be performed.

Remote sensing‐derived indicators of ecosystem states are gaining new ground due to the possibilities they bring to be applied inexpensively over large areas. Remotely sensed albedo has been often used to monitor drylands due to its close relationship with ecosystem status and climate. Here, we used a space‐for‐time‐substitution approach to evaluate whether albedo (averaged from 2000 to 2016) can identify multiple ecosystem states in African drylands spanning from the Saharan desert to tropical Africa. By using latent class analysis, we found that albedo showed two states (low and high; the cut‐off level was 0.22 at the shortwave band). Potential analysis revealed that albedo exhibited an abrupt and discontinuous increase with increased aridity (1 − [precipitation/potential evapotranspiration]). The two albedo states co‐occurred along aridity values ranging from 0.72 to 0.78, during which vegetation cover exhibited a rapid, continuous decrease from {\textasciitilde}90\% to {\textasciitilde}50\%. At aridity values of 0.75, the low albedo state started to exhibit less attraction than the high albedo state. Low albedo areas beyond this aridity value were considered as vulnerable regions where abrupt shifts in albedo may occur if aridity increases, as forecasted by current climate change models. Our findings indicate that remotely sensed albedo can identify two ecosystem states in African drylands. They support the suitability of albedo indices to inform us about discontinuous responses to aridity experienced by drylands, which can be linked to the onset of land degradation.},

            Declines in animal body sizes are widely reported and likely impact ecological interactions and ecosystem services. For harvested species subject to multiple stressors, limited understanding of the causes and consequences of size declines impedes prediction, prevention, and mitigation. We highlight widespread declines in Pacific salmon size based on 60 years of measurements from 12.5 million fish across Alaska, the last largely pristine North American salmon-producing region. Declines in salmon size, primarily resulting from shifting age structure, are associated with climate and competition at sea. Compared to salmon maturing before 1990, the reduced size of adult salmon after 2010 has potentially resulted in substantial losses to ecosystems and people; for Chinook salmon we estimated average per-fish reductions in egg production (−16\%), nutrient transport (−28\%), fisheries value (−21\%), and meals for rural people (−26\%). Downsizing of organisms is a global concern, and current trends may pose substantial risks for nature and people.},

We ﬁt Bayesian hierarchical models to thousands of observations from over two decades to quantify four components of variation – spatial (local and regional) and temporal (local and coherent); and to model their drivers. We found strong support for three propositions: (1) spatial variation at local and regional scales are large and roughly equal, (2) annual temporal variation is mostly local rather than coherent, and, (3) spatial variation exceeds temporal variation. Our ﬁndings imply that predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes at macroscales requires consideration of the dominant spatial signals at both local and regional scales that may overwhelm temporal signals.},

The gain or loss of particular species and the disruption of key interactions are both consequences and drivers of global change that can lead to the disassembly of ecological networks. We examined whether the disruption of a hummingbird–mistletoe–marsupial mutualism by the invasion of non-native species can have cascading effects on both pollination and seed dispersal networks in the temperate forest of Patagonia, Argentina. We focused on network motifs, subnetworks composed of a small number of species exhibiting particular patterns of interaction, to examine the structure and diversity of mutualistic networks. We found that the hummingbird–mistletoe–marsupial mutualism plays a critical role in the community by increasing the complexity of pollination and seed dispersal networks through supporting a high diversity of interactions. Moreover, we found that the disruption of this tripartite mutualism by non-native ungulates resulted in diverse indirect effects that led to less complex pollination and seed dispersal networks. Our results demonstrate that the gains and losses of particular species and the alteration of key interactions can lead to cascading effects in the community through the disassembly of mutualistic networks.},

            Running waters contribute substantially to global carbon fluxes through decomposition of terrestrial plant litter by aquatic microorganisms and detritivores. Diversity of this litter may influence instream decomposition globally in ways that are not yet understood. We investigated latitudinal differences in decomposition of litter mixtures of low and high functional diversity in 40 streams on 6 continents and spanning 113° of latitude. Despite important variability in our dataset, we found latitudinal differences in the effect of litter functional diversity on decomposition, which we explained as evolutionary adaptations of litter-consuming detritivores to resource availability. Specifically, a balanced diet effect appears to operate at lower latitudes versus a resource concentration effect at higher latitudes. The latitudinal pattern indicates that loss of plant functional diversity will have different consequences on carbon fluxes across the globe, with greater repercussions likely at low latitudes.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have greatly advanced our understanding of the processes that regulate trophic structure and dynamics in ecosystems. However, the causes of systematic variation among ecosystems remain controversial and poorly elucidated. Contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in particular have inspired much speculation, but only recent empirical quantification. Here, we review evidence for systematic differences in energy flow and biomass partitioning between producers and herbivores, detritus and decomposers, and higher trophic levels. The magnitudes of different trophic pathways vary considerably, with less herbivory, more decomposers and more detrital accumulation on land. Aquatic–terrestrial differences are consistent across the global range of primary productivity, indicating that structural contrasts between the two systems are preserved despite large variation in energy input. We argue that variable selective forces drive differences in plant allocation patterns in aquatic and terrestrial environments that propagate upward to shape food webs. The small size and lack of structural tissues in phytoplankton mean that aquatic primary producers achieve faster growth rates and are more nutritious to heterotrophs than their terrestrial counterparts. Plankton food webs are also strongly size-structured, while size and trophic position are less strongly correlated in most terrestrial (and many benthic) habitats. The available data indicate that contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial food webs are driven primarily by the growth rate, size and nutritional quality of autotrophs. Differences in food-web architecture (food chain length, the prevalence of omnivory, specialization or anti-predator defences) may arise as a consequence of systematic variation in the character of the producer community.},

While many studies have considered biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) relationships at local scales within single realms, there is a critical need for more studies examining BEF linkages among ecological realms, across scales, and across trophic levels. We present a framework linking abiotic attributes, productivity, and biodiversity across terrestrial and inland aquatic realms. We review examples of the major ways that BEF linkages form across realms–cross-system subsidies, ecosystem engineering, and hydrology. We then formulate testable hypotheses about the relative strength of these connections across spatial scales, realms, and trophic levels. While some studies have addressed these hypotheses individually, to holistically understand and predict the impact of biodiversity loss on ecosystem function, researchers need to move beyond local and simpliﬁed systems and explicitly investigate cross-realm and trophic interactions and large-scale patterns and processes. Recent advances in computational power, data synthesis, and geographic information science can facilitate studies spanning multiple ecological realms that will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of BEF connections.},

While such difference likely affects the indirect effects among species and consequently network persistence, it remains overlooked. Here, using a dynamic model, we show that networks structured by phenology favour facilitation over competition within guilds of pollinators and plants, thereby increasing network persistence, while the contrary holds for networks structured by morphology. We further show that such buffering of competition by phenological traits mostly beneficiate to specialists, the most vulnerable species otherwise, which propagate the most positive effects within guilds and promote nestedness. Our results indicate that beyond trophic mismatch, phenological shifts such as those induced by climate change are likely to affect indirect effects within mutualistic assemblages, with consequences for biodiversity.},

For a given ecosystem of n species, the 2n variables representing the inflows and abundances of the n species are related in the n equations that define the system's steady states. There are 2n alternative ways of designating, for each species, either an inflow or an abundance variable as an independent variable and the other (i.e., its conjugate variable) as a dependent variable. Each of these alternative ways defines a unique configuration of constraints in the influence propagation through the ecosystem network. In particular, designating as independent variables the inflow variables of all but two focal species leaves their abundance variables free to change, thus leading to the evaluation of the total effect between the two focal species. On the other hand, choosing their abundance variables as independent variables to fix prohibits influence to pass through any of these intermediate species, thus selectively evaluating the direct effect between the two focal species. Any other way between these two extreme cases sets partial constraints on influence propagation, thus evaluating a partial effect between the two species. Four categories of effects between two species--inflow to abundance, abundance to abundance, inflow to inflow, and abundance to inflow--can be distinguished and explicitly evaluated in terms of community matrix elements.},

Here, we clarify the correspondence and distinctions among the Interaction matrix, the Alpha matrix, and the Jacobian matrix, terms that are frequently used interchangeably as well as synonymously with the term “community matrix.” We illustrate how these matrices correspond to different ways of characterizing interaction strengths, how they permit insights regarding different types of press perturbations, and how these are related by a simple scaling relationship. Connections to additional interaction strength characterizations encapsulated by the Beta matrix, the Gamma matrix, and the Removal matrix are also discussed.

	abstract = {Local dynamics are influenced by regional processes. Meta-ecology, or the study of spatial flows of energy, materials, and species between local systems, is becoming increasingly concerned with accurate depictions of species movements and the impacts of this movement on landscape-level ecosystem function. Indeed, incorporating diverse types of movement is a major frontier in metacommunity theory. Here, we synthesize literature to demonstrate that the movement of organisms between patches is governed by the interplay between both a species’ ability to move and the combined effects of landscape structure and physical flows (termed abiotic controls), which together we refer to as abiotic-dependent species connectivity. For example, two lakes that share geographic proximity may be inaccessible for mobile fish species because they lack a river connecting them (landscape structure), but wind currents may disperse insects between them (physical flows). Empirical evidence suggests that abiotic controls, such as ocean currents, lead to abiotic-dependent species connectivity and that, in nature, this type of connectivity is the rule rather than the exception. Based on this empirical evidence, we introduce a novel mathematical framework to demonstrate how species movement capabilities and abiotic conditions, can interact to influence metacommunity stability. We apply this framework to predict how incorporating abiotic-dependent species connectivity applies to classic empirical examples of aquatic, aquatic-terrestrial, and terrestrial experimental metacommunities. We demonstrate that incorporating abiotic-dependent species connectivity into metacommunity models can lead to a much broader range of dynamics than models previously predicted, including a wider range of metacommunity stability. Our framework fills critical gaps in our basic understanding of organismal movement across landscapes and provides testable predictions for how such common natural phenomena impact landscape-level ecosystem function. Finally, we present future perspectives for further development of meta-ecological theory from questions about fragmentation to ecosystems. Anthropogenic change is not only leading to habitat loss from the damming of rivers to denuding the landscape, but altering the physical flows that have historically connected communities. Thus, recognizing the importance of these processes in tandem with species’ movement abilities is critical for predicting and preserving the structure and function of ecological communities.},

We investigated how the type of subsidy and top predator presence influenced reciprocal flows of energy, by manipulating the addition of terrestrial leaf and terrestrial insect subsidies to experimental freshwater pond mesocosms with and without predatory fish. Over 18 months, fortnightly addition of subsidies (terrestrial beetle larvae) to top-predators was crossed with monthly addition of subsidies (willow leaves) to primary consumers in mesocosms with and without top predators (upland bullies) in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design in four replicate blocks. Terrestrial insect subsidies increased reciprocal flows, measured as the emergence of aquatic insects out of mesocosms, but leaf subsidies dampened those effects. However, the presence of fish and snails, consumers with no terrestrial life stage, usurped and retained the energy within in the aquatic ecosystem, creating a cross-ecosystem bottleneck to energy flow. Thus, changes in species composition of donor or recipient food webs within a meta-ecosystems can alter reciprocal subsidies through cross-ecosystem bottlenecks.},

            It has long been anticipated that relating functional traits to species demography would be a cornerstone for achieving large-scale predictability of ecological systems. If such a relationship existed, species demography could be modeled only by measuring functional traits, transforming our ability to predict states and dynamics of species-rich communities with process-based community models. Here, we introduce a new method that links empirical functional traits with the demographic parameters of a process-based model by calibrating a transfer function through inverse modeling. As a case study, we parameterize a modified Lotka–Volterra model of a high-diversity mountain grassland with static plant community and functional trait data only. The calibrated trait–demography relationships are amenable to ecological interpretation, and lead to species abundances that fit well to the observed community structure. We conclude that our new method offers a general solution to bridge the divide between trait data and process-based models in species-rich ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Global change drivers like warming and changing nutrient cycles have a
substantial impact on ecosystem functioning. In most modelling studies,
organism responses to warming are described through the temperature
dependence of their biological rates. In nature, however, organisms are
more than their biological rates. Plants are flexible in their elemental
composition (stoichiometry) and respond to variance in nutrient
availability and temperature. An increase in plant carbon-to-nutrient
content means a decrease in food quality for herbivores. Herbivores can
react to this decrease by compensatory feeding, which implies higher
feeding rates and higher carbon excretion to optimize nutrient
acquisition. In a novel model of a nutrient-plant-herbivore system, we
explored the consequences of flexible stoichiometry and compensatory
feeding for plant and herbivore biomass production and survival across
gradients in temperature and nutrient availability. We found that
flexible stoichiometry increases plant and herbivore biomasses, which
results from increased food availability due to higher plant growth.
Surprisingly, compensatory feeding decreased plant and herbivore
biomasses as overfeeding by the herbivore reduced plants to low
densities and depleted their resource. Across a temperature gradient,
compensatory feeding caused herbivore extinction at a lower temperature,
while flexible stoichiometry increased its extinction threshold. Our
results suggest that compensatory feeding can become critical under warm
conditions. In contrast, flexible stoichiometry is beneficial for plants
up to a certain temperature threshold. These findings demonstrate the
importance of accounting for adaptive and behavioural organismal
responses to nutrient and temperature gradients when predicting the
consequences of warming and eutrophication for population dynamics and
survival.},

            Ecosystems are composed of complex networks of many species interacting in different ways. While ecologists have long studied food webs of feeding interactions, recent studies increasingly focus on mutualistic networks including plants that exchange food for reproductive services provided by animals such as pollinators. Here, we synthesize both types of consumer-resource interactions to better understand the controversial effects of mutualism on ecosystems at the species, guild, and whole-community levels. We find that consumer-resource mechanisms underlying plant-pollinator mutualisms can increase persistence, productivity, abundance, and temporal stability of both mutualists and non-mutualists in food webs. These effects strongly increase with floral reward productivity and are qualitatively robust to variation in the prevalence of mutualism and pollinators feeding upon resources in addition to rewards. This work advances the ability of mechanistic network theory to synthesize different types of interactions and illustrates how mutualism can enhance the diversity, stability, and function of complex ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Some three-species motifs (unique patterns of interactions between three species) are both more stable when modeled in isolation and over-represented in empirical food webs. This suggests that these motifs may reduce extinction risk for species participating in them, ultimately stabilizing the food web as a whole. We test whether a species’ time to extinction following a perturbation is related to its participation in stable and unstable motifs and assess how motif roles co-vary with a species’ degree or trophic level. We found that species’ motif roles are related to their times to extinction following a disturbance. Speciﬁcally, participating in many omnivory motifs (whether in absolute terms, as a proportion of the species’ role, or relative to other species in the network) was associated with more rapid extinction, even though omnivory has previously been identiﬁed as a stable motif. Participating in the other three stable motifs (three-species chain, apparent competition, and direct competition) was associated with longer times to extinction. While motif roles were associated with extinction risk, they also varied strongly with degree and trophic level. This means that these simpler measures of a species’ role may be suﬃcient to roughly predict which species are most vulnerable to disturbance, but the additional information encapsulated in a motif role can further reﬁne predictions of vulnerability. Moreover, where researchers are a priori interested in motif roles, our results conﬁrm that these roles can be interpreted with respect to extinction risk.},

Among these are the moisture-limited vegetation systems in semi-arid (SA) regions of the World, which support approximately 36 per cent of the human population, maintain considerable biodiversity and which are susceptible to rapid stress-induced collapse. Change in spatially self-organized vegetation patterning has previously been proposed as a means of identifying approaching thresholds in these systems. In this paper, a newly developed cellular automata model is used to explore spatial patterning and also the temporal dynamics of SA vegetation cover. Results show, for the first time, to my knowledge, in a cellular automata model, that ‘critical slowdown’ (a pronounced reduction in post-perturbation recovery rates) provides clear signals of system fragility as major thresholds are approached. A consequence of slowing recovery rates is the appearance of quasi-stable population states and increased potential for perturbation-induced multi-staged population collapse. The model also predicts a non-patterned cover where environmental stress levels are high, or where more moderate stress levels are accompanied by frequent perturbations. In the context of changing climatic and environmental pressures, these results provide observable indicators of fragility and threshold proximity in SA vegetation systems that have direct relevance to management policies.},

We show that when communities have fewer species, persistence is more likely if positive interactions—such as mutualism and commensalism—are prevalent. In species-rich communities, the disproportionate effect of positive interactions on persistence is diluted and different combinations of biotic interaction types can coexist without affecting persistence significantly.

              INTRODUCTION
              A surprisingly general pattern at very large scales casts light on the link between ecosystem structure and function. We show a robust scaling law that emerges uniquely at the level of whole ecosystems and is conserved across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. This pattern describes the changing structure and productivity of the predator-prey biomass pyramid, which represents the biomass of communities at different levels of the food chain. Scaling exponents of the relation between predator versus prey biomass and community production versus biomass are often near ¾, which indicates that very different communities of species exhibit similar high-level structure and function. This recurrent community growth pattern is remarkably similar to individual growth patterns and may hint at a basic process that reemerges across levels of organization.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              We assembled a global data set for community biomass and production across 2260 large mammal, invertebrate, plant, and plankton communities. These data reveal two ecosystem-level power law scaling relations: (i) predator biomass versus prey biomass, which indicates how the biomass pyramid changes shape, and (ii) community production versus community biomass, which indicates how per capita productivity changes at a given level in the pyramid. Both relations span a wide range of ecosystems along large-scale biomass gradients. These relations can be linked theoretically to show how pyramid shape depends on flux rates into and out of predator-prey communities. In order to link community-level patterns to individual processes, we examined community size structure and, particularly, how the mean body mass of a community relates to its biomass.
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                Across ecosystems globally, pyramid structure becomes consistently more bottom-heavy, and per capita production declines with increasing biomass. These two ecosystem-level patterns both follow power laws with near ¾ exponents and are shown to be robust to different methods and assumptions. These structural and functional relations are linked theoretically, suggesting that a common community-growth pattern influences predator-prey interactions and underpins pyramid shape. Several of these patterns are highly regular (
                R
                2
                {\textgreater} 0.80) and yet are unexpected from classic theories or from empirical relations at the population or individual level. By examining community size structure, we show these patterns emerge distinctly at the ecosystem level and independently from individual near ¾ body-mass allometries.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Systematic changes in biomass and production across trophic communities link fundamental aspects of ecosystem structure and function. The striking similarities that are observed across different kinds of systems imply a process that does not depend on system details. The regularity of many of these relations allows large-scale predictions and suggests high-level organization. This community-level growth pattern suggests a systematic form of density-dependent growth and is intriguing given the parallels it exhibits to growth scaling at the individual level, both of which independently follow near ¾ exponents. Although we can make ecosystem-level predictions from individual-level data, we have yet to fully understand this similarity, which may offer insight into growth processes in physiology and ecology across the tree of life.

            Ecosystems exhibit surprising regularities in structure and function across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. We assembled a global data set for 2260 communities of large mammals, invertebrates, plants, and plankton. We find that predator and prey biomass follow a general scaling law with exponents consistently near ¾. This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood. These patterns suggest a greater degree of ecosystem-level organization than previously recognized and a more predictive approach to ecological theory.},

Yet, emerging evidence suggests that this conception of limitation may be incomplete, because chronic predation risk heightens herbivore metabolic rate and shifts demand from N-rich proteins to soluble carbohydrate–carbon (C). Because soluble C can be limiting, predation risk may cause ecosystem elemental cycling rates and stoichiometric balance to depend on herbivore physiological plasticity. We report on a stoichiometrically explicit ecosystem model that investigates this problem. The model tracks N, and soluble and recalcitrant C through ecosystem compartments. We evaluate how soluble plant C influences C and N stocks and flows in the presence and absence of predation risk. Without risk, herbivores are limited by N and respire excess C so that plant-soluble C has small effects only on elemental stocks and flows. With predation risk, herbivores are limited by soluble C and release excess N, so plant-soluble C critically influences ecosystem elemental stocks flows. Our results emphasize that expressing ecosystem stoichiometric balance using customary C : N ratios that do not distinguish between soluble and recalcitrant C may not adequately describe limitations on elemental cycling.},

The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to inﬁnity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow signiﬁcantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum ampliﬁcation (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this ampliﬁcation occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the ﬂow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predator–prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a perturbation. Key words: compartment models; eigenvalues; pulse perturbations; reactivity; relative stability; resilience; return time; transient vs. asymptotic dynamics.},

In particular, interaction effects may propagate in a spatial dimension, to localities connected by organismal movement. Here we study the propagation of interaction effects with a spatially explicit metacommunity model, where local sites are connected by dispersal, foraging, or by both types of movement. We show that indirect pairwise effects are, in most cases, of the same sign as direct effects if localities are connected by dispersing species. However, if foraging is prevalent, this correspondence is broken, and indirect effects between species often have a different sign than direct effects. This highlights the importance of indirect interactions across space and their inherent unpredictability in complex settings with species foraging across local patches. Further, the effect of a species over another in a local patch does not necessarily correspond to its effect at the metacommunity scale; this correspondence is again mediated by the type of movement across localities. Every species, despite their trophic position or spatial range, displays a non-zero net effect over every other species in our model metacommunities. Thus we show that local dynamics and local interactions between species can trigger indirect effects all across the set of connected patches, and these effects have a distinct signature depending on whether the prevalent connection between patches is via dispersal or via foraging. However, the magnitude of this effect between any two species strongly decays with the distance between them. These theoretical results strengthen the importance of considering indirect effects across species at both the community and metacommunity levels, highlight the differences between types of movement across locations, and thus open novel avenues for the study of interaction effects in spatially explicit settings.},

              BACKGROUND
              Modern advances in remote-sensing technology are providing unprecedented opportunities to accurately measure the global distribution of carbon held in biomass within ecosystems. Such highly spatially resolved measures of biomass carbon are intended to provide an accurate inventory of global carbon storage within ecosystems. They are also needed to test the accuracy of carbon cycle models that predict how global changes that alter biogeochemical functions—such as carbon assimilation via photosynthesis, carbon losses via plant and microbial respiration, and organic matter deposition in soils and sediments—will affect net ecosystem carbon uptake and storage. Emerging ecological theory predicts that wild animals stand to play an important role in mediating these biogeochemical processes. Furthermore, many animal species roam widely across landscapes, creating a spatial dynamism that could regulate spatial patterning of vegetation biomass and carbon uptake and soil carbon retention. But such zoogeochemical effects are not measured by current remote-sensing approaches nor are they factored into carbon cycle models. Studies are now providing new quantitative insights into how the abundance, diversity, and movement of animal species across landscapes influence the nature and magnitude of zoogeochemical affects. These insights inform how to account for animals in remote-sensing applications and in carbon cycle models to more accurately predict carbon exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere in the face of global environmental change.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              Zoogeochemical effects have been measured using manipulative experiments that exclude or add focal wild animal species or along landscape gradients where animal abundances or diversity vary naturally. Our review of these studies, which cover a wide diversity of taxa (vertebrates and invertebrates and large- and small-bodied organisms) and ecosystems, reveals that animals can increase or decrease rates of biogeochemical processes, with a median change of 40\% but ranging from 15 to 250\% or more. Moreover, models that embody zoogeochemical effects reveal the potential for considerable under- or overestimates in ecosystem carbon budgets if animal effects are not considered. The key challenge, in light of these findings, is comprehensively accounting for spatially dynamic animal effects across landscapes. We review new developments in spatial ecosystem ecology that offer the kind of analytical guidance needed to link animal movement ecology to geospatial patterning in ecosystem carbon uptake and storage. Considerations of animal movement will require highly resolved spatially explicit understanding of landscape features, including topography, climate, and the spatial arrangement of habitat patches and habitat connectivity within and among ecosystems across landscapes. We elaborate on advances in remote-sensing capabilities that can deliver these critical data. We further review new geospatial statistical methods that, when combined with remote-sensing data and spatial ecosystem modeling, offer the means to comprehensively understand and predict how zoogeochemical-driven landscape processes regulate spatial patterns in carbon distribution.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              There is growing interest to slow climate change by enlisting ecological processes to recapture atmospheric carbon and store it within ecosystems. Wild animal species are rarely considered as part of the solution. Instead, it is often held that managing habitat space to conserve wild animals will conflict with carbon storage. Our integrative review offers a pathway forward for deciding when and how conserving or managing a diversity of animal species could in fact enhance ecosystem carbon uptake and storage. Such understanding informs international climate and biodiversity initiatives such as those described by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and national biodiversity strategies and climate action plans. All of these initiatives require better resolution of how biodiversity effects on ecosystem structure and biogeochemical functioning will become altered by global change.

            Predicting and managing the global carbon cycle requires scientific understanding of ecosystem processes that control carbon uptake and storage. It is generally assumed that carbon cycling is sufficiently characterized in terms of uptake and exchange between ecosystem plant and soil pools and the atmosphere. We show that animals also play an important role by mediating carbon exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere, at times turning ecosystem carbon sources into sinks, or vice versa. Animals also move across landscapes, creating a dynamism that shapes landscape-scale variation in carbon exchange and storage. Predicting and measuring carbon cycling under such dynamism is an important scientific challenge. We explain how to link analyses of spatial ecosystem functioning, animal movement, and remote sensing of animal habitats with carbon dynamics across landscapes.},

Ecosystem components can range from species or functional groups, to different functional traits, or even the cover of different habitats in a landscape mosaic. We make use of n-dimensional hypervolumes to deﬁne ecosystem states and assess how much they shift after environmental changes have occurred. We demonstrate the value of this framework with a study case on the effects of environmental change on Alpine ecosystems.

Warming-induced tipping points in Arctic and alpine treeless ecosystems are, however, little understood. Here, we compare two long-term recruitment datasets of 2,770 shrubs from coastal East Greenland and from the Tibetan Plateau against atmospheric circulation patterns between 1871 and 2010 Common Era. Increasing rates of shrub recruitment since 1871 reached critical tipping points in the 1930s and 1960s on the Tibetan Plateau and in East Greenland, respectively. A recent decline in shrub recruitment in both datasets was likely related to warmer and drier climates, with a stronger May to July El Niño Southern Oscillation over the Tibetan Plateau and a stronger June to July Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation over Greenland. Exceeding the thermal optimum of shrub recruitment, the recent warming trend may cause soil moisture deficit. Our findings suggest that changes in atmospheric circulation explain regional climate dynamics and associated response patterns in Arctic and alpine shrub communities, knowledge that should be considered to protect vulnerable high-elevation and high-latitude ecosystems from the cascading effects of anthropogenic warming.All shrub recruitment data used for analyses are available in Dataset S1.

            The question of what and how to measure ecological resilience has been troubling ecologists since Holling 1973's seminal paper in which he defined resilience as the ability of a system to withstand perturbations without shifting to a different state. This definition moved the focus from studying the local stability of a single attractor to which a system always converges, to the idea that a system may converge to different states when perturbed. These two concepts have later on led to the definitions of engineering (local stability) vs ecological (non-local stability) resilience metrics.  While engineering resilience is associated to clear metrics, measuring ecological resilience has remained elusive. As a result, the two notions have been studied largely independently from one another and although several attempts have been devoted to mapping them together in some kind of coherent framework, the extent to which they overlap or complement each other in quantifying the resilience of a system is not yet fully understood.    In this perspective, we focus on metrics that quantify resilience following Holling's definition based on the concept of a stability landscape. We explore the relationships between different engineering and ecological resilience metrics derived from bistable systems and show that, for low dimensional ecological models, the correlation between engineering and ecological resilience can be high. We also review current approaches for measuring resilience from models and data, and we outline challenges which, if answered, could help us make progress towards a more reliable quantification of resilience in practice.},

Therefore, our limited knowledge of ecological dynamics may suggest that it is hard to identify those species in the system that display early warning signals. Here, we show that, in mutualistic ecological systems, it is possible to identify species that early anticipate critical transitions by knowing only the system structure—that is, the network topology of plant–animal interactions. Specifically, we leverage the mathematical theory of structural observability of dynamical systems to identify a minimum set of “sensor species,” whose measurement guarantees that we can infer changes in the abundance of all other species. Importantly, such a minimum set of sensor species can be identified by using the system structure only. We analyzed the performance of such minimum sets of sensor species for detecting early warnings using a large dataset of empirical plant–pollinator and seed-dispersal networks. We found that species that are more likely to be sensors tend to anticipate earlier critical transitions than other species. Our results underscore how knowing the structure of multispecies systems can improve our ability to anticipate critical transitions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Most ecosystems are affected by anthropogenic or natural pulse disturbances, which alter the community composition and functioning for a limited period of time. Whether and how quickly communities recover from such pulses is central to our understanding of biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem organisation, but also to nature conservation and management. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 508 (semi-)natural field experiments globally distributed across marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We found recovery to be significant yet incomplete. At the end of the experiments, disturbed treatments resembled controls again when considering abundance (94\%), biomass (82\%), and univariate diversity measures (88\%). Most disturbed treatments did not further depart from control after the pulse, indicating that few studies showed novel trajectories induced by the pulse. Only multivariate community composition on average showed little recovery: disturbed species composition remained dissimilar to the control throughout most experiments. Still, when experiments revealed a higher compositional stability, they tended to also show higher functional stability. Recovery was more complete when systems had high resistance, whereas resilience and resistance were negatively correlated. The overall results were highly consistent across studies, but significant differences between ecosystems and organism groups appeared. Future research on disturbances should aim to understand these differences, but also fill obvious gaps in the empirical assessments for regions (especially the tropics), ecosystems and organisms. In summary, we provide general evidence that (semi-)natural communities can recover from pulse disturbances, but compositional aspects are more vulnerable to long-lasting effects of pulse disturbance than the emergent functions associated to them.},

	abstract = {Heterotrophic bacteria perform two major functions in the transformation of organic matter: They produce new bacterial biomass (bacterial secondary production [BP]), and they respire organic C to inorganic C (bacterial respiration [BR]). For planktonic bacteria, a great deal has been learned about BP and its regulation during the past several decades but far less has been learned about BR. Our lack of knowledge about BR limits our ability to understand the role of bacteria in the carbon cycle of aquatic ecosystems. Bacterial growth efﬁciency (BGE) is the amount of new bacterial biomass produced per unit of organic C substrate assimilated and is a way to relate BP and BR: BGE = (BP)/(BP + BR). Estimates of BGE for natural planktonic bacteria range from {\textless}0.05 to as high as 0.6, but little is known about what might regulate this enormous range. In this paper we review the physiological and ecological bases of the regulation of BGE. Further, we assemble the literature of the past 30 years for which both BP and BR were measured in natural planktonic ecosystems and explore the relationship between BGE and BP. Although the relationship is variable, BGE varies systematically with BP and the trophic richness of the ecosystem. In the most dilute, oligotrophic systems, BGE is as low as 0.01; in the most eutrophic systems, it plateaus near 0.5. Planktonic bacteria appear to maximize carbon utilization rather than BGE. A consequence of this strategy is that maintenance energy costs (and therefore maintenance respiration) seems to be highest in oligotrophic systems.},

	abstract = {Resource edibility is a crucial factor in ecological theory on the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down control. Current theory explains trophic structure in terms of the relative abundance and succession of edible and inedible species across gradients of primary productivity. We argue that this explanation is incomplete owing to its focus on inedibility and the assumption that plants and herbivores have fixed defense levels. Consumer-induced defenses are an important source of variation in the vulnerability of prey and are prevalent in natural communities. Such induced defenses decrease per capita consumption rates of consumers but hardly ever result in complete inedibility. When defenses are inducible a prey population may consist of both undefended and defended individuals. Here we use food chain models with realistic parameter values to show that variation in consumption rates on different prey types causes a gradual instead of stepwise increase in the biomass of all trophic levels in response to enrichment. Such all-level responses have been observed in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and in microbial food chains in the laboratory. We stress that, in addition to the known food web effects of interspecific variation in edibility, intraspecific variation in edibility is another form of within-trophic-level heterogeneity that also has such effects. We conclude that inducible defenses increase the relative importance of bottom-up control.},

Here I will show that, from biochemical considerations, N : C should increase linearly and P : C quadratically with relative growth rate in autotrophs with the consequence that N : P increases at low relative growth rates, passes a maximum and then decreases at high relative growth rates. These predictions are veriﬁed against observations for a freshwater alga (Selenastrum minutum) and a tree seedling (Betula pendula). Changes in temperature, light or other factors that affect the growth rate of autotrophs interact with nutrient supply in such a way that there are no simple rules for as to how N : P will change.},

              Elevated deposition of atmospheric nitrogen (N) has shifted nutrient availability in terrestrial and aquatic habitats of ecosystems, but rarely are ecosystem processes in those components examined simultaneously.

              alters litter decomposition in terrestrial and stream systems. We also used short-term phosphorus (P) enrichment experiments within both watersheds to determine whether chronic N enrichment enhances P limitation of decomposition. Leaves from N-treated and reference watersheds were used in a reciprocal design to parse effects of altered nutrient availability in leaves and in the environment. We found divergent responses of terrestrial and stream decomposition to altered nutrient regimes. Chronic experimental N enrichment increased N and P concentrations in post-abscission leaves which decayed faster than leaves from the reference watershed in the terrestrial environment. Experimental N enrichment also did not induce P limitation of terrestrial decomposition. In contrast, litter decomposition rate in the two streams was not enhanced by elevated N in stream water or by altered leaf chemistry. Instead, chronic experimental N enrichment shifted decomposition in streams from co-limitation to strong P limitation. Microbial respiration and extracellular enzyme production responded to altered nutrient availability in a manner consistent with resource allocation models. Divergent responses of terrestrial and aquatic decomposition to elevated N deposition likely arise from differences in water bioavailability. Our work highlights the value of simultaneously considering ecosystem processes in terrestrial and aquatic systems to understand the consequences of integrated landscape processes operating on large spatial scales.},

	abstract = {The potential for complex synergistic or antagonistic interactions between multiple stressors presents one of the largest uncertainties when predicting ecological change but, despite common use of the terms in the scientiﬁc literature, a consensus on their operational deﬁnition is still lacking. The identiﬁcation of synergism or antagonism is generally straightforward when stressors operate in the same direction, but if individual stressor effects oppose each other, the deﬁnition of synergism is paradoxical because what is synergistic to one stressor’s effect direction is antagonistic to the others. In their highly cited meta-analysis, Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) assumed in situations with opposing individual effects that synergy only occurs when the cumulative effect is more negative than the additive sum of the opposing individual effects. We argue against this and propose a new systematic classiﬁcation based on an additive effects model that combines the magnitude and response direction of the cumulative effect and the interaction effect. A new class of “mitigating synergism” is identiﬁed, where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced. We applied our directional classiﬁcation to the dataset compiled by Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) to determine the prevalence of synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions. Compared to their original analysis, we report differences in the representation of interaction classes by interaction type and we document examples of mitigating synergism, highlighting the importance of incorporating individual stressor effect directions in the determination of synergisms and antagonisms. This is particularly pertinent given a general bias in ecology toward investigating and reporting adverse multiple stressor effects (double negative). We emphasize the need for reconsideration by the ecological community of the interpretation of synergism and antagonism in situations where individual stressor effects oppose each other or where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced.},

In the past decades, much effort has been devoted to infer the importance of a particular structure by its capacity to tolerate an external perturbation on its structure or dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that such a perspective leads to inconsistent conclusions. That is, the importance of a network structure changes as a function of the external perturbations acting on a community at any given point in time. Thus, we discuss a research agenda to investigate the relative importance of the structure of ecological networks under an environment-­dependent framework. We hypothesize that only by studying systematically the link between network structure and community dynamics under an environment-­dependent framework, we can uncover the limits at which communities can tolerate environmental changes.},

It corresponds to the proportion of species that are disconnected from the rest of the network when extinctions occur sequentially. Classically, the robustness is calculated for a given network, from the simulation of a large number of extinction sequences. The link between network structure and robustness remains an open question. Setting a joint probabilistic model on the network and the extinction sequences allows analysis of this relation. Bipartite stochastic block models have proven their ability to model bipartite networks for example, plant-pollinator networks: species are divided into blocks and interaction probabilities are determined by the blocks of membership. Analytical expressions of the expectation and variance of robustness are obtained under this model, for different distributions of primary extinction sequences. The impact of the network structure on the robustness is analyzed through a set of properties and numerical illustrations. The analysis of a collection of bipartite ecological networks allows us to compare the empirical approach to our probabilistic approach, and illustrates the relevance of the latter when it comes to computing the robustness of a partially observed or incompletely sampled network.},

One observation that, at ﬁrst sight, seems incompatible with this idea is the fact that the establishment of new plants in dry areas is often restricted to shady sites under the canopy of other plants, called ‘‘nurse plants.’’ We use a graphical model to resolve this paradox. The model visualizes how facilitative patterns can be understood from the simultaneous effects of plant canopies on microsite light and moisture, and the growth responses of establishing seedlings to those factors. The approach emphasizes the fact that positive and negative effects of plant canopies always occur simultaneously. In the presented light–water model, facilitation only occurs when the improvement of plant water relations under the canopy exceeds the costs caused by lower light levels. This may be true under dry conditions, whereas in less dry situations, competition rather than facilitation is observed. The model shows how changes in water availability may shift interactions from competitive to facilitative and vice versa, as observed in some ﬁeld patterns. It is argued that other environmental factors explaining facilitative patterns can be understood in the same context.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the importance of globally well-constrained carbon:nitrogen: phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios in planktonic biomass to the understanding of nutrient cycles and biotic feedbacks in marine ecosystems, we looked for analogous patterns in forest ecosystems worldwide. We used data from the literature to examine the stoichiometry of C, N, and P in forest foliage and litter on both global and biome levels. Additionally, we examined the scaling of nutrient investments with biomass and production both globally and within biomes to determine if and when these ratios respond to macroscale ecosystem properties (such as nutrient availability). We found that, while global forest C:N:P ratios in both foliage and litter were more variable than those of marine particulate matter, biome level (temperate broadleaf, temperate coniferous, and tropical) ratios were as constrained as marine ratios and statistically distinct from one another. While we were more interested in the relative constancy of the C:N:P ratios than their numerical value we did note, as have others, that the atomic ratios calculated for foliage (1212:28:1) and litter (3007:45:1) reﬂect the increased proportion of C-rich structural material characteristic of terrestrial vegetation. Carbon : nutrient ratios in litter were consistently higher than in comparable foliar data sets, suggesting that resorption of nutrients is a globally important mechanism, particularly for P. Litter C:N ratios were globally constant despite biome-level differences in foliar C:N; we speculate that this strong coupling may be caused by the signiﬁcant contribution of immobile cell wall bound proteins to the total foliar N pool. Most ratios scaled isometrically across the range of biomass stocks and production in all biomes suggesting that ratios arise directly from physiological constraints and are insensitive to factors leading to shifts in biomass and production. There were, however, important exceptions to this pattern: nutrient investment in broadleaf forest litter and coniferous forest foliage increased disproportionately relative to C with increasing biomass and production suggesting a systematic inﬂuence of macroscopic factors on ratios.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Species can persist when the environment changes by shifting their ranges through dispersal or by adapting to the new conditions that they experience. Thus, we might expect that dispersal and adaptation in combination would increase persistence. Using a simulation model, we show that this may not be the case. Instead, species competition causes dispersal and adaptation to have conflicting contributions to biodiversity maintenance. Dispersal and adaptation each independently increase biodiversity maintenance. But when species both disperse and evolve, faster adapting species persist in their current ranges, preventing others from shifting their ranges to track environmental change. These findings highlight the need to consider ecological and evolutionary processes together, or we risk underestimating how global change will impact biodiversity.
          , 
            Dispersal and adaptation both allow species to persist in changing environments. Yet, we have limited understanding of how these processes interact to affect species persistence, especially in diverse communities where biotic interactions greatly complicate responses to environmental change. Here we use a stochastic metacommunity model to demonstrate how dispersal and adaptation to environmental change independently and interactively contribute to biodiversity maintenance. Dispersal provides spatial insurance, whereby species persist on the landscape by shifting their distributions to track favorable conditions. In contrast, adaptation allows species to persist by allowing for evolutionary rescue. But, when species both adapt and disperse, dispersal and adaptation do not combine positively to affect biodiversity maintenance, even if they do increase the persistence of individual species. This occurs because faster adapting species evolve to hold onto their initial ranges (i.e., monopolization effects), thus impeding slower adapting species from shifting their ranges and thereby causing extinctions. Importantly, these differences in adaptation speed emerge as the result of competition, which alters population sizes and colonization success. By demonstrating how dispersal and adaptation each independently and interactively contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity, we provide a framework that links the theories of spatial insurance, evolutionary rescue, and monopolization. This highlights the expectation that the maintenance of biodiversity in changing environments depends jointly on rates of dispersal and adaptation, and, critically, the interaction between these processes.},

Here, we investigate how the life history of 910 natural populations of animals and plants predicts their intrinsic ability to be resilient. We show that demographic resilience can be achieved through different combinations of compensation, resistance and recovery after a disturbance. We demonstrate that these resilience components are highly correlated with life history traits related to the species’ pace of life and reproductive strategy. Species with longer generation times require longer recovery times post-­disturbance, whilst those with greater reproductive capacity have greater resistance and compensation. Our findings highlight the key role of life history traits to understand species resilience, improving our ability to predict how natural populations cope with disturbance regimes.},

	abstract = {Autotrophic organisms reveal an astounding ﬂexibility in their elemental stoichiometry, with potentially major implications on biogeochemical cycles and ecological functioning. Notwithstanding, stoichiometric regulation, and co-limitation by multiple resources in autotrophs were in the past often described by heuristic formulations. In this study, we present a mechanistic model of autotroph growth, which features two major improvements over the existing schemes. First, we introduce the concept of metabolic network independence that deﬁnes the degree of phase-locking between accessory machines. Network independence is in particular suggested to be proportional to protein synthesis capability as quantiﬁed by variable intracellular N:C. Consequently, the degree of co-limitation becomes variable, contrasting with the dichotomous debate on the use of Liebig’s law or the product rule, standing for constantly low and high co-limitation, respectively. Second, we resolve dynamic protein partitioning to light harvesting, carboxylation processes, and to an arbitrary number of nutrient acquisition machineries, as well as instantaneous activity regulation of nutrient uptake. For all regulatory processes we assume growth rate optimality, here extended by an explicit consideration of indirect feed-back effects. The combination of network independence and optimal regulation displays unprecedented skill in reproducing rich stoichiometric patterns collected from a large number of published chemostat experiments. This high skill indicates (1) that the current paradigm of ﬁxed co-limitation is a critical short-coming of conventional models, and (2) that stoichiometric ﬂexibility in autotrophs possibly reﬂects an optimality strategy. Numerical experiments furthermore show that regulatory mechanisms homogenize the effect of multiple stressors. Extended optimality alleviates the effect of the most limiting resource(s) while down-regulating machineries for the less limiting ones, which induces an ubiquitous response surface of growth rate over ambient resource levels. Our approach constitutes a basis for improved mechanistic understanding and modeling of acclimative processes in autotrophic organisms. It hence may serve future experimental and theoretical investigations on the role of those processes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.},

Best understood in autotroph-based systems, co-occurrence of these constraints may be common but remains poorly studied in detrital-based systems. Here, we used a laboratory growth experiment to test limitation of the detritivorous caddisfly larvae Pycnopsyche lepida across a concurrent gradient of oak litter quantity (food supply) and quality (phosphorus : carbon [P:C ratios]). Growth increased simultaneously with quantity and quality, indicating co-limitation across the resource gradients. We merged approaches of ecological stoichiometry and co-limitation theory, showing how co-limitation reflected shifts in C and P acquisition throughout homeostatic regulation. Increased growth was best explained by elevated consumption rates and improved P assimilation, which both increased with elevated quantity and quality. Notably, C assimilation efficiencies remained unchanged and achieved maximum 18\% at low quantity despite pronounced C limitation. Detrital C recalcitrance and substantive post-assimilatory C losses probably set a minimum quantity threshold to achieve positive C balance. Above this threshold, greater quality enhanced larval growth probably by improving P assimilation toward P-intensive growth. We suggest this interplay of C and P acquisition contributes to detritivore co-limitation, highlighting quantity and quality as potential simultaneous bottom-up controls in detrital-based ecosystems, including under anthropogenic change like nutrient enrichment.},

One approach uses limitation scenarios of factorial  growth assays to distinguish specific types of co-limitation; the other uses growth  responses spanned over a continuous, multi-dimensional resource space to  characterise different types of response surfaces. Both approaches have been useful  in investigating particular aspects of co-limitation, but a synthesis is needed to  stimulate development of this recent research area. We address this gap by  integrating the two approaches, thereby presenting a more general framework of  co-limitation. We found that various factorial (co-)limitation scenarios can emerge  in different response surface types based on continuous availabilities of essential  or substitutable resources. We tested our conceptual co-limitation framework on data  sets of published and unpublished studies examining the limitation of two  herbivorous consumers in a two-dimensional resource space. The experimental data  corroborate the predictions, suggesting a general applicability of our co-limitation  framework to generalist consumers and potentially also to other organisms. The  presented framework might give insight into mechanisms that underlie co-limitation  responses and thus can be a seminal starting point for evaluating co-limitation  patterns in experiments and nature.},

Here we use the Eltonian niche as an overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of “gray areas” between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species’ niches (if any) they wish to address.

Deposition of anthropogenically derived atmospheric nitrogen controls whether N or P is growth-limiting for phytoplankton. Under elevated conditions of atmospheric N inputs, lake phytoplankton become consistently P-limited because the N:P ratio is strongly distorted. This is in contrast to conditions of low N deposition when lake phytoplankton are N-limited. These effects are even observed in remote lakes, demonstrating the indirect yet wide-ranging effects of humans on global food webs.

            Deposition of anthropogenically derived nitrogen can cause phosphorus to become the limiting nutrient of lake phytoplankton.
          , 
            Human activities have more than doubled the amount of nitrogen (N) circulating in the biosphere. One major pathway of this anthropogenic N input into ecosystems has been increased regional deposition from the atmosphere. Here we show that atmospheric N deposition increased the stoichiometric ratio of N and phosphorus (P) in lakes in Norway, Sweden, and Colorado, United States, and, as a result, patterns of ecological nutrient limitation were shifted. Under low N deposition, phytoplankton growth is generally N-limited; however, in high–N deposition lakes, phytoplankton growth is consistently P-limited. Continued anthropogenic amplification of the global N cycle will further alter ecological processes, such as biogeochemical cycling, trophic dynamics, and biological diversity, in the world’s lakes, even in lakes far from direct human disturbance.},

	abstract = {Ecological processes leave distinct structural imprints on the species interactions that shape the topology of mutualistic networks. Detecting those relationships is not trivial since they go beyond pairwise interactions, but may get blurred when considering full network descriptors. Recent work has shown that the network meso-scale can capture this important information. The meso-scale describes network subgraphs representing patterns of interactions between a small number of species (i.e., motifs) that constitute the building blocks of the whole network. Despite the possible implications of network motifs to better capture species interactions, they remain overlooked in natural plant-pollinator networks. By exploring 60 empirical plant-pollinator networks from 18 diﬀerent studies with wide geographical coverage we show that some motifs are consistently under- or over-represented worldwide, suggesting that the building blocks of plant-pollinator networks are not random. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that distinct motif positions describing species ecological roles (e.g., generalisation and number of indirect interactions) are occupied by diﬀerent plant and ﬂoral visitor groups on both trophic levels. Bees appear less frequently in specialised motif positions with high number of indirect interactions, while the rest of ﬂoral visitor groups are infrequent in generalised motif positions with low number of indirect interactions. All plant groups tend to be over-represented on specialised motif positions, except tall plant species with separated sexes (e.g., woody dioecious or monoecious species), which are more frequent on motif positions with low number of indirect interactions. Interestingly, the realized combinations of diﬀerent species groups within a motif can not be retrieved from their joint probability distributions, indicating that group combinations are not random either. Our result highlights the non-random structure of the meso-scale on plant-pollinators networks and the association of diﬀerent plant and ﬂoral visitor groups with certain motifs that involve diﬀerent ecological roles at a macro-ecological scale.},

            Climate change is altering the seasonal timing of biological events, effectively rescheduling the potential interactions among species. We know specialist consumers suffer when they fail to synchronize with their prey; however, little is known about how generalist consumers respond to phenological shifts across multiple food resources. This reshuffling may create novel temporal overlap between foods that were once separated in time. We examined how a generalist consumer, the Kodiak brown bear, responded when two key foods, red elderberry and sockeye salmon, became synchronized. Bears switched from eating salmon to elderberries, disrupting an ecological link that typically fertilizes terrestrial ecosystems and generates high mortality rates for salmon. These results demonstrate an underappreciated mechanism by which climate-altered phenologies can alter food webs.
          , 
            
              Climate change is altering the seasonal timing of life cycle events in organisms across the planet, but the magnitude of change often varies among taxa [Thackeray SJ, et al. (2016)
              Nature
              535:241–245]. This can cause the temporal relationships among species to change, altering the strength of interaction. A large body of work has explored what happens when coevolved species shift out of sync, but virtually no studies have documented the effects of climate-induced synchronization, which could remove temporal barriers between species and create novel interactions. We explored how a predator, the Kodiak brown bear (
              Ursus arctos middendorffi
              ), responded to asymmetric phenological shifts between its primary trophic resources, sockeye salmon (
              Oncorhynchus nerka
              ) and red elderberry (
              Sambucus racemosa
              ). In years with anomalously high spring air temperatures, elderberry fruited several weeks earlier and became available during the period when salmon spawned in tributary streams. Bears departed salmon spawning streams, where they typically kill 25–75\% of the salmon [Quinn TP, Cunningham CJ, Wirsing AJ (2016)
              Oecologia
              183:415–429], to forage on berries on adjacent hillsides. This prey switching behavior attenuated an iconic predator–prey interaction and likely altered the many ecological functions that result from bears foraging on salmon [Helfield JM, Naiman RJ (2006)
              Ecosystems
              9:167–180]. We document how climate-induced shifts in resource phenology can alter food webs through a mechanism other than trophic mismatch. The current emphasis on singular consumer-resource interactions fails to capture how climate-altered phenologies reschedule resource availability and alter how energy flows through ecosystems.},

However, it is unclear how local extinctions affect regional processes, such as the distribution of diversity in space, especially if extinctions show spatial patterns, such as being clustered. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate extinctions and their consequences in a spatially explicit framework. Using highly controlled microcosm experiments and theoretical models, we ask here how the number and spatial autocorrelation of extinctions interactively affect metacommunity dynamics. We found that local patch extinctions increased local diversity (
              α

              β

            It has long been anticipated that relating functional traits to species demography would be a cornerstone for achieving large-scale predictability of ecological systems. If such a relationship existed, species demography could be modeled only by measuring functional traits, transforming our ability to predict states and dynamics of species-rich communities with process-based community models. Here, we introduce a new method that links empirical functional traits with the demographic parameters of a process-based model by calibrating a transfer function through inverse modeling. As a case study, we parameterize a modified Lotka–Volterra model of a high-diversity mountain grassland with static plant community and functional trait data only. The calibrated trait–demography relationships are amenable to ecological interpretation, and lead to species abundances that fit well to the observed community structure. We conclude that our new method offers a general solution to bridge the divide between trait data and process-based models in species-rich ecosystems.},

Mean concentrations of nutrient elements measured (N, P, S, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Fe, Zn, Cu) in tissues are relatively low, and nutrient stocks in vegetation are low compared with other forests because of the low concentrations and the relative youth of the forest (cut in 1909-17). The largest fractions of nutrients in aboveground net primary production (NPP) go into leaves-58-78\% of all nutrients except Na (45\%)-although leaves are only 40\% of aboveground NPP. Net community (woody) growth included -30\% of aboveground NPP, but smaller fractions of nutrients (7\% of N and K to 21\% of Ca and 28\% of Na). Nitrogen, P, and some other elements are retracted from dying leaves; but concentrations of Ca, Mn, and Na increase from living to dead leaves, branches, and stem wood. Return to the soil from aboveground is primarily by leaching for K and Na but by litterfall for other elements. "Throughflow" is defined as nutrient uptake needed beyond that in NPP to provide for both leaching and increase in dead tissues before they fall. For Na, throughflow exceeds uptake into NPP; but negative throughflows for N and P reflect conservation of these elements. Belowground plant nutrient stocks are 0.25 to 0.5 x and belowground uptake rates into NPP are 0.1 to 0.2x aboveground values for most elements, but belowground values are higher for N, P, Na, and Fe. Significant amounts of some elements, especially S, Ca, K, and Na, are exuded from roots as part of the total, above- and belowground throughflow. Behaviors of nutrient elements can be characterized by ratios expressing concentration into leaves vs. woody tissues and relative leachability and throughflow vs. conservation. Relative turnover rates compare litterfall plus leaching with aboveground stocks or with nutrient contents of NPP. Turnover rates increase in the sequence: N and P; Ca; Mg, K, Fe, and Mn; S; and Na. Means and coefficients of variation of foliage nutrient concentrations express some differences between ecosystems. Comparing different ecosystems, coefficients of variation are low for N and P, intermediate for Ca, K, Mg, and Al, and high for Si, Mn, Fe, Cl, and Na. Differences in these and other expressions of element behavior can be interpreted on the basis of function in plants.},

	abstract = {Heterotrophic microbial decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi, immobilize or mineralize inorganic elements, depending on their elemental composition and that of their organic resource. This fact has major implications for their interactions with other consumers of inorganic elements. We combine the stoichiometric and resource-ratio approaches in a model describing the use by decomposers of an organic and an inorganic resource containing the same essential element, to study its consequences on decomposer interactions and their role in elemental cycling. Our model considers the elemental composition of organic matter and the principle of its homeostasis explicitly. New predictions emerge, in particular, (1) stoichiometric constraints generate a trade-off between the R∗ values of decomposers for the two resources; (2) they create favorable conditions for the coexistence of decomposers limited by different resources and with different elemental demands; (3) however, combined with conditions on species-speciﬁc equilibrium limitation, they draw decomposers toward colimitation by the organic and inorganic resources on an evolutionary time scale. Moreover, we derive the conditions under which decomposers switch from consumption to excretion of the inorganic resource. We expect our predictions to be useful in explaining the community structure of decomposers and their interactions with other consumers of inorganic resources, particularly primary producers.},

Disruptions of N cycling by soil freezing, insect defoliation, or drought have been suggested to explain this pattern. We developed a model of nitrogen dynamics demonstrating that most of the long-term pattern can be reproduced without explicit consideration of these events. Comparisons of simulated N ﬂuxes between high and low export years suggested that inorganic N input to the soil, from both atmospheric N deposition and N mineralization, was signiﬁcantly higher during periods of high streamﬂow NO3− ﬂux than in low periods. Simulated inorganic N pools (ammonium and nitrate) and ﬂuxes (nitriﬁcation, plant uptake, denitriﬁcation, and ammonia volatilization) were also signiﬁcantly higher in these periods. By swapping the time sequences of inorganic N input between high and low export years, it was shown that N mineralization, not atmospheric N deposition, drives the simulated long-term pattern. Although simulated nitriﬁcation showed a stronger relationship with measured streamﬂow NO3− ﬂux than did N mineralization, nitriﬁcation rate depended upon availability of soil ammonium supplied from N mineralization. Because N mineralization in the model varies only with soil temperature and moisture, we conclude that shifts in the interaction of these two variables over time produced the shifts in NO3− stream exports.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems constantly adjust to altered biogeochemical inputs, changes in vegetation and climate, and previous physical disturbances. Such disturbances create overlapping ‘biogeochemical legacies’ affecting modern nutrient mass balances. To understand how ‘legacies’ affected watershed-ecosystem (WEC) biogeochemistry during five decades of studies within the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), we extended biogeochemical trends and hydrologic fluxes back to 1900 to provide an historical framework for our long-term studies. This reconstruction showed acid rain peaking at HBEF in the late 1960s-early 1970s near the beginning of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study (HBES). The long-term, parabolic arc in acid inputs to HBEF generated a corresponding arc in the ionic strength of stream water, with acid inputs generating increased losses of H+ and soil base cations between 1963 and 1969 and then decreased losses after 1970. Nitrate release after disturbance is coupled with previous N-deposition and storage, biological uptake, and hydrology. Sulfur was stored in soils from decades of acid deposition but is now nearly depleted. Total exports of base cations from the soil exchange pool represent one of the largest disturbances to forest and associated aquatic ecosystems at the HBEF since the Pleistocene glaciation. Because precipitation inputs of base cations currently are extremely small, such losses can only be replaced through the slow process of mineral weathering. Thus, the chemistry of stream water is extremely dilute and likely to become even more dilute than pre-Industrial Revolution estimates. The importance of calculating chemical fluxes is clearly demonstrated in reconstruction of acid rain impacts during the pre-measurement period. The aggregate impact of acid rain on WEC exports is far larger than historical forest harvest effects, and even larger than the most severe deforestation experiment (Watershed 2) at HBEF. A century of acid rain had a calcium stripping impact equivalent to two W2 experiments involving complete deforestation and herbicide applications.},

Although there is evidence that terrestrial carbon can be incorporated into the tissues of aquatic consumers, its ability to enhance consumer production has been debated. Our research aims to evaluate the net effect of t-OC input on zooplankton. We used a survey of zooplankton production and resource use in ten lakes along a naturally occurring gradient of t-OC concentration to address these questions. Total and group-speciﬁc zooplankton production was negatively related to t-OC. Residual variation in zooplankton production that was not explained by t-OC was negatively related to terrestrial resource use (allochthony) by zooplankton. These results challenge the designation of terrestrial carbon as a resource subsidy; rather, the negative effect of reduced light penetration on the amount of suitable habitat and the low resource quality of t-OC appear to diminish zooplankton production. Our ﬁndings suggest that ongoing continental-scale increases in t-OC concentrations of lakes will likely have negative impacts on the productivity of aquatic food webs.},

For example, several studies concluded that although t-POC only represented ≈20\% of the flux of particulate carbon available to herbivorous zooplankton, this food source accounted for ≈50\% of the C incorporated by zooplankton. We tested the direct dietary impact of t-POC (from the leaves of riparian vegetation) and various phytoplankton on

Before salmon spawners arrived, autotrophic biofilms were nitrogen (N)-limited, or co-limited by N and phosphorus (P), whereas heterotrophic biofilms were either P-limited, or co-limited by N and P. Combined N and P amendments resulted in a 2.6-fold increase in biofilm chlorophyll a, and a 3.2fold increase in community respiration. After salmon arrived, autotroph nutrient limitation was alleviated in six of the seven streams. Heterotrophs still exhibited nutrient limitation in six streams, but most streams shifted from co-limitation to P-limitation. Nutrient-diffusing substrata amended with salmon tissue indicated that salmon could also be an important source of organic carbon for biofilms. Autotrophs responded less to N and P amendments as streamwater ammonium concentration increased with the arrival of salmon. For heterotrophs, ammonium concentration and N:P ratio best predicted changes in response following the arrival of salmon.

	abstract = {Nutrient cycling is a key process linking organisms in ecosystems. This is especially apparent in stream environments in which nutrients are taken up readily and cycled through the system in a downstream trajectory. Ecological stoichiometry predicts that biogeochemical cycles of different elements are interdependent because the organisms that drive these cycles require ﬁxed ratios of nutrients. There is growing recognition that animals play an important role in biogeochemical cycling across ecosystems. In particular, dense aggregations of consumers can create biogeochemical hotspots in aquatic ecosystems via nutrient translocation. We predicted that ﬁlter-feeding freshwater mussels, which occur as speciose, high-biomass aggregates, would create biogeochemical hotspots in streams by altering nutrient limitation and algal dynamics. In a ﬁeld study, we manipulated nitrogen and phosphorus using nutrient-diffusing substrates in areas with high and low mussel abundance, recorded algal growth and community composition, and determined in situ mussel excretion stoichiometry at 18 sites in three rivers (Kiamichi, Little, and Mountain Fork Rivers, southcentral United States). Our results indicate that mussels greatly inﬂuence ecosystem processes by modifying the nutrients that limit primary productivity. Sites without mussels were Nlimited with ;26\% higher relative abundances of N-ﬁxing blue-green algae, while sites with high mussel densities were co-limited (N and P) and dominated by diatoms. These results corroborated the results of our excretion experiments; our path analysis indicated that mussel excretion has a strong inﬂuence on stream water column N:P. Due to the high N:P of mussel excretion, strict N-limitation was alleviated, and the system switched to being co-limited by both N and P. This shows that translocation of nutrients by mussel aggregations is important to nutrient dynamics and algal species composition in these rivers. Our study highlights the importance of consumers and this imperiled faunal group on nutrient cycling and community dynamics in aquatic ecosystems.},

The transfe materials across the terrestrial-to-marine boundary is considered to be driven by hydrological connectivity, but anim movement can provide another pathway for nutrient transfers. In two separate studies we assessed the role mam (bats and kangaroos) play in alleviating nutrient limitation in mangrove forests in Australia. At Lizard Island measured tree growth and foliar elemental and isotopie composition of trees growing within and outside a large fly fox roost. In Western Australia, we measured foliar elemental and isotopie composition of trees within two fore frequented by kangaroos that feed in spinifex grasslands and shelter in the shade of the mangroves. We compar those with mangroves from adjacent forests that are not frequented by kangaroos. We show that at both locations, th mangrove forest receives terrestrial nutrient subsidies through animal movement. At Lizard Island dominant mangrov species were significantly enriched in nitrogen within the bat roost, as evidenced by higher foliar N concentratio (by up to 150\%), N : P and N : C ratios in trees within the roost compared with trees outside the roost. The isot signature of foliar N was significantly enriched in 15N by l-3\%o within the roost, further suggesting that the so of the N enrichment was the bat roost. Growth rates of mangroves within the roost were nearly six times higher th trees outside the roost. In the arid coast of Western Australia, we show elevated foliar 15N abundance of up to 3\% mangroves where kangaroos shelter relative to trees where they do not. Thus, this study presents two examples f mammalian herbivore mediated localized transport of nutrients from terrestrial to marine ecosystems, consequen affecting mangrove tree growth, productivity and forest structure.},

Most studies of euphotic zone export focus on passive ﬂuxes, that is, sinking particles. However, active transport, the vertical transfer of material by migrating zooplankton, can also be an important component of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) removal from the surface ocean. Here we demonstrate that active transport is an especially important mechanism for phosphorus (P) removal from the euphotic zone at Station ALOHA (Hawaii Ocean Timeseries program; 221450N, 1581W), a P-stressed site in the North Paciﬁc Subtropical Gyre. Migrant excretions in this region are P-rich (C51:N12:P1) relative to sinking particles (C250:N31:P1), and migrant-mediated P ﬂuxes are almost equal in magnitude (82\%) to P ﬂuxes from sediment traps. Migrant zooplankton biomass and therefore the importance of this P removal pathway relative to sinking ﬂuxes has increased signiﬁcantly over the past 12 years, suggesting that active transport may be a major driving force for enhanced P-limitation of biological production in the NPSG. We further assess the C:N:P composition of zooplankton size fractions at Station ALOHA (C88:N18:P1, on average) and discuss migrant-mediated P export in light of the balance between zooplankton and suspended particle stoichiometries. We conclude that, because active transport is such a large component of the total P ﬂux and signiﬁcantly impacts ecosystem stoichiometry, export processes involving migrant zooplankton must be included in large-scale efforts to understand biogeochemical cycles.},

            Biodiversity is declining globally, but its different taxonomic, functional, and evolutionary attributes are doing so at a different pace. Understanding how these attributes influence ecosystem functioning is crucial to better predict the ecological consequences of biodiversity loss. Based on a survey of 123 drylands worldwide, our results highlight the phylogenetic and functional attributes of subordinate species as key drivers of the provision of multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously (multifunctionality). Our study expands our understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality by identifying the diversity of early diverging lineages and functional redundancy as important biodiversity attributes to prioritize in conservation and restoration programs aimed at promoting dryland multifunctionality worldwide.
          , 
            Biodiversity encompasses multiple attributes such as the richness and abundance of species (taxonomic diversity), the presence of different evolutionary lineages (phylogenetic diversity), and the variety of growth forms and resource use strategies (functional diversity). These biodiversity attributes do not necessarily relate to each other and may have contrasting effects on ecosystem functioning. However, how they simultaneously influence the provision of multiple ecosystem functions related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling (multifunctionality) remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional attributes of dominant (mass ratio effects) and subordinate (richness effect) plant species on the multifunctionality of 123 drylands from six continents. Our results highlight the importance of the phylogenetic and functional attributes of subordinate species as key drivers of multifunctionality. In addition to a higher taxonomic richness, we found that simultaneously increasing the richness of early diverging lineages and the functional redundancy between species increased multifunctionality. In contrast, the richness of most recent evolutionary lineages and the functional and phylogenetic attributes of dominant plant species (mass ratio effects) were weakly correlated with multifunctionality. However, they were important drivers of individual nutrient cycles. By identifying which biodiversity attributes contribute the most to multifunctionality, our results can guide restoration efforts aiming to maximize either multifunctionality or particular nutrient cycles, a critical step to combat dryland desertification worldwide.},

	abstract = {Abstract Habitat loss is known to pervade extinction thresholds in metapopulations. Such thresholds result from a loss of stability that can eventually lead to collapse. Several models have been developed to understand the nature of these transitions and how they are affected by the locality of interactions, fluctuations or external drivers. Most models consider the impact of grazing or aridity as a control parameter that can trigger sudden shifts, once critical values are reached. Others explore instead the role played by habitat loss and fragmentation. Here we consider a minimal model incorporating facilitation between the individuals of the same species along with habitat destruction, with the aim of understanding how local cooperation and habitat loss interact with each other. A mathematical model incorporating facilitation and habitat destruction is derived, along with a spatially explicit simulation model. It is found that a catastrophic shift is expected for increasing levels of habitat loss, but the bifurcation becomes continuous when dispersal is local. Under these conditions, spatial patchiness is found and the qualitative change from discontinuous to continuous results are in agreement with previous studies on ecological systems. Our results suggest that species exhibiting facilitation and displaying short-range dispersal will be markedly more capable of avoiding catastrophic tipping points.},

	abstract = {Nutritional deﬁciencies are a very common phenomenon, and consumers generally face food that is not optimally suited for their needs. Especially herbivores are habitually confronted with food of inferior quality, usually a result of too-low nutrient concentrations in plant material. Waterﬂeas of the genus Daphnia are good model organisms to study the effect of inferior quality food, and how animals deal with this. We tested the effect of algae to which we had given different phosphorus contents on both life history and feeding parameters of Daphnia magna. Phosphorus content of the algae strongly affected both the growth rate and the feeding activity of the daphniids. Feeding activity increased with declining food quality (increase in C:P ratio of the algae), whereas growth rates were maximal at intermediate C:P levels. We conclude that the direct limitation of phosphorus is a very important factor determining food quality for zooplankters. Daphniids counterbalanced lower P content of their food by spending more C (energy) on acquiring this limiting resource. This implies that when Daphnia are given phosphorus-limited food both the addition of phosphorus and the addition of carbon (energy) should increase the growth rate of the animals (co-limitation). The inﬂuence of the phosphorus content of the food on the feeding activity of Daphnia offers a mechanistic explanation for the observed homeostasis in daphniids.},

Ecological stoichiometry studies the elemental balance of ecological processes and offers a uniquely quantitative, transferrable way to assess food quality using elemental ratios, e.g., carbon (C):nitrogen (N). Here, we test whether snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) vary their home range size in response to spatial patterns of C:N, C:phosphorus (P), and N:P ratios of two preferred boreal forage species, lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) and red maple (Acer rubrum), in summer months. Boreal forests are N- and P-limited ecosystems and access to N- and P-rich forage is paramount to snowshoe hares’ survival. Accordingly, we consider forage with higher C content relative to N and P to be lower quality than forage with lower relative C content. We combine elemental distribution models with summer home range size estimates to test the hypothesis that home range size will be smaller in areas with access to high, homogeneous food quality compared to areas of low, heterogeneous food quality. Our results show snowshoe hares had smaller home ranges in areas where lowbush blueberry foliage quality was higher or more spatially homogenous than in areas of lower, more heterogeneous food quality. By responding to spatial patterns of food quality, consumers may influence community and ecosystem processes by, for example, varying nutrient recycling rates. Our reductionist biogeochemical approach to viewing resources leads us to holistic insights into consumer spatial ecology.},

	abstract = {Recently, a number of studies have reported somewhat contradictory patterns of temporal trends in arthropod abundance, from decline to increase. Arthropods often exhibit non-monotonous variation in abundance over time, making it important to account for temporal coverage in interpretation of abundance trends, which is often overlooked in statistical analysis. Combining four recently analysed datasets that led to contrasting outcomes, we first show that temporal abundance variations of arthropods are non-monotonous. Using simulations, we show non-monotony is likely to bias estimated linear abundance trends. Finally, analysing empirical data, we show that heterogeneity in estimated abundance trends is significantly related to the variation in temporal baseline of analysed time series. Once differences in baseline years, habitats and continents are accounted for, we do not find any statistical difference in estimated linear abundance trends among the four datasets. We also show that short time series produce more stochastic abundance trends than long series, making the dearth of old and long-term time series a strong limitation in the assessment of temporal trends in arthropod abundance. The lack of time series with a baseline year before global change acceleration is likely to lead to an underestimation of global change effects on biodiversity.},

We use a comprehensive data set extracted from the literature to test the relative explanatory power of two contrasting bodies of ecological theory, the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and ecological stoichiometry (ES), for per-capita and population-level rates of herbivory across ecosystems. We found that ambient temperature and herbivore body size (MTE) as well as stoichiometric mismatch (ES) both constrained herbivory, but at different scales of biological organization. Herbivore body size, which varied over 11 orders of magnitude, was the primary factor explaining variation in per-capita rates of herbivory. Stoichiometric mismatch explained more variation in population-level herbivory rates and also in per-capita rates when we examined data from within functionally similar trophic groups (e.g. zooplankton). Thus, predictions from metabolic and stoichiometric theories offer complementary explanations for patterns of herbivory that operate at different scales of biological organization.},

	abstract = {Describing the relative magnitude and controls of herbivory and decomposition is important in understanding the trophic transference, recycling, and storage of carbon and nutrients in diverse ecosystems. We examine the variability in herbivory and decomposition between and within a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We also analyze how that variability is associated with differences in net primary production and producer nutritional quality. Net primary production and producer nutritional quality are uncorrelated between the two types of system or within either type. Producer nutritional quality is correlated to the percentage of primary production consumed by herbivores or percentage of detrital production decomposed annually, regardless of whether the comparison is made between the two types of systems or within either type of system. Thus, producer nutritional quality stands out as a consistent indicator of the importance of consumers as top-down controls of producer biomass and detritus accumulation and nutrient recycling. However, absolute consumption by herbivores and absolute decomposition (both in g C·rn-2·ye l) are often associated with absolute primary production and independent of producer nutritional quality, because the variability in net primary production across systems largely exceeds that in the percentage consumed or decomposed. Thus, primary production often stands out as an indicator of the absolute flux of producer carbon transferred to consumers and of the potential levels of secondary production maintained in the system. These patterns contribute to our understanding of the variability and control of herbivory and decomposition, and implications on carbon and nutrient cycling, in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, Furthermore, in view of their robustness, they may offer a template for global change models seeking to predict anthropogenic effects on carbon and nutrient fluxes.},

In two experiments, mayﬂy nymphs were given high or low quantities of food at different carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratios and their growth was measured. Low food quantity resulted in negative growth rates in both experiments, regardless of food P content. However, under high food availability, mayﬂy growth was affected by the type of food eaten, with low C:P ratio food producing more rapid growth. In addition, mayﬂy growth increased somewhat when P-poor food was artiﬁcially enriched with inorganic P although this effect was not statistically signiﬁcant. Mayﬂy body P content was inversely related to body size but increased in animals fed artiﬁcially P-enriched food. A model was constructed to simulate mass balance constraints on mayﬂy growth imposed by the relative supply of two elements (C and P) in food. The model shows that mayﬂy growth should be limited by food P content at moderately low C:P ratios (c. 120, by mass). Given high C:P ratios (mean c. 270, by mass) in periphyton from oligotrophic boreal lakes, our experimental and theoretical results indicate that stoichiometric constraints are important factors affecting benthic food webs in lakes from the Canadian Shield and perhaps in other systems with similarly high C:P ratios in periphyton.},

We used a stoichiometric model that coupled animal bioenergetics and body elemental composition to estimate TER of carbon and phosphorus (TERC:P) for 41 aquatic consumer taxa. We found a wide range in TERC:P (77–3086, ratio by atoms), which was generated by interspeciﬁc differences in body C : P ratios and gross growth efﬁciencies of C. TERC:P also varied among aquatic invertebrates having different feeding strategies, such that detritivores had signiﬁcantly higher threshold ratios than grazers and predators. The higher TERC:P in detritivores resulted not only from lower gross growth efﬁciencies of carbon but also reﬂected lower body P content in these consumers. Supporting previous stoichiometric theory, we found TERC:P to be negatively correlated with the maximum growth rate of invertebrate consumers. By coupling bioenergetics and stoichiometry, this analysis revealed strong linkages among the physiology, ecology and evolution of nutritional demands for animal growth.},

	abstract = {In heterogeneous landscapes, large herbivores employ plastic behavioral strategies to buffer themselves against negative effects of environmental variation on ﬁtness. Yet, the mechanisms by which individual responses to such variation scale up to inﬂuence population performance remain uncertain. Analyses of space-use behaviors exemplify this knowledge gap, because such behaviors are often assumed, but rarely demonstrated, to have direct ﬁtness consequences. We combined ﬁne-scale data on forage biomass and quality with movement data and measures of somatic energy reserves to determine whether variation in use (the quantity of resource units, e.g., pixels on a landscape, that receive some level of investment by an animal during a speciﬁc sampling period) or selection (use of a resource unit relative to its availability to the animal during the same sampling period) of the nutritional landscape predicted early winter body condition of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). At the population level, mule deer exhibited stronger selection for high forage biomass at the landscape scale than at the home-range scale, and during summer than during spring. Use of the nutritional landscape varied among individual deer and had important consequences for early winter condition (an important determinant of survival and reproduction in capital-breeding ungulates). Females that consistently used vegetation communities that provided high biomass of preferred forage plants throughout spring and summer entered winter in better condition than females that used those vegetation communities less frequently. In contrast, selection (i.e., use relative to availability) of the nutritional landscape by individual deer was not signiﬁcantly related to early winter condition at either the landscape or home-range scales. Our results highlight the value of using mechanistic, nutritional approaches to understand the potential ﬁtness consequences of individual variation in behavior. In addition, our study suggests that patterns of forage use by ungulates may sometimes correlate more strongly with ﬁtness than patterns of forage selection, which are scale-dependent and more vulnerable to biases stemming from the need to accurately quantify availability.},

Yet the magnitude and direction of predator impacts on carbon cycling have not been widely quantified for terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we report on analyses of the potential for gray wolves to have cascading impacts on ecosystem carbon cycling. Our goal is to provide reasonable first approximations of their potential role in this fundamental ecosystem process. We find that gray wolves could lead to an increase in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of 24.0–52.0 g C·m−2·yr−1 in Isle Royale’s boreal forest, and a decrease in NEP of 30.03–102.88 g C·m−2·yr−1 in Yellowstone’s grasslands. If such gray wolf impacts scale up to the broader North American boreal and grassland gray wolf range, these estimates suggest a potential for the indirect effects of wolves on yearly carbon fluxes to be on the same order of magnitude as the fossil fuel emissions of 6–20 million passenger cars per year. While considerable heterogeneity and uncertainty in gray wolf effects is likely to exist over both time and space, our results suggest that it may be worth examining in more detail the potential significance of the indirect effects of top predators on terrestrial ecosystem carbon using more systematic landscape-s­ cale sampling in locations with and without wolves.},

	abstract = {Background
              Every year, billions of migratory animals cross the planet in pursuit of increased foraging opportunities, improved safety, and higher reproductive output. In so doing, these migrants transport nutrients, energy, and other organisms (including seeds, mollusks, parasites, and pathogens) between disparate locations. Migrants also forage and are preyed upon throughout their journeys, thereby establishing transport and trophic interactions with resident communities. Migratory animals thus couple ecological communities across the globe and may mediate their diversity and stability. However, as yet, the influence of migrants and their services on these communities is often overlooked, and as a consequence of global changes, migrations are threatened worldwide.
            
            
              Advances
              We review several examples in which interactions between migratory animals and resident communities have been quantified, illustrating the processes by which migrants may uniquely alter energy flow, food-web topology and stability, trophic cascades, and the structure and dynamics of (meta-)communities. For example, the inputs of nutrients and energy originating from distant localities by migrants can dramatically increase resource availability, with rippling consequences for productivity at various trophic levels and the potential to drive the transition between alternative stable states. Migrant-mediated transport of propagules of other organisms can lead to the establishment of new or lost species, as well as influencing gene flow and genetic mixing among resident populations. Similarly, migrants can alter parasite transmission, diversity, and evolution by harboring a broader range of parasites than residents and by either facilitating or hindering the long-distance dispersal of parasites.
              Foraging by migrants can also have profound effects on community processes and ecosystem functions. For instance, grazing by migratory animals can alter nutrient cycling, primary productivity, biomass of edible plants, competitive interactions between plant species, and ultimately, the composition and long-term persistence of the entire plant community. The most striking difference between migrant and resident consumers is, however, the pulsed nature of migrant utilization and the timing of their interactions. Together, these fundamentally define the relationship between migrant abundance and primary production (in the case of migrant herbivores) or the stability of food webs (in the case of migratory predators).
            
            
              Outlook
              Our Review demonstrates that the highly predictable, seasonally pulsed nature of animal migration, together with the spatial scales at which it operates and the immense number of individuals involved, not only set migration apart from other types of movement, but render it a uniquely potent, yet underappreciated, dimension of biodiversity that is intimately embedded within resident communities. Given the potential for migration to influence ecological networks worldwide, we suggest integrative network approaches, through which studies of community dynamics and ecosystem functioning may explicitly consider animal migrations, understand the ramifications of their declines, and assist in developing effective conservation measures.
            
          , 
            Animal migrations span the globe, involving immense numbers of individuals from a wide range of taxa. Migrants transport nutrients, energy, and other organisms as they forage and are preyed upon throughout their journeys. These highly predictable, pulsed movements across large spatial scales render migration a potentially powerful yet underappreciated dimension of biodiversity that is intimately embedded within resident communities. We review examples from across the animal kingdom to distill fundamental processes by which migratory animals influence communities and ecosystems, demonstrating that they can uniquely alter energy flow, food-web topology and stability, trophic cascades, and the structure of metacommunities. Given the potential for migration to alter ecological networks worldwide, we suggest an integrative framework through which community dynamics and ecosystem functioning may explicitly consider animal migrations.

            Migration Monitor
            
              Seasonal migrations move large numbers of animals across often vast distances. Such movement shifts large amounts of biomass from one region to another, but, perhaps more importantly, moves animals that eat, excrete, and sometimes die in multiple remote systems. Such movements impact the communities, trophic structure, and function of these ecosystems in often underappreciated ways.

              Until the past century or so, the movement of wild animals was relatively unrestricted, and their travels contributed substantially to ecological processes. As humans have increasingly altered natural habitats, natural animal movements have been restricted. Tucker
              et al.
              examined GPS locations for more than 50 species. In general, animal movements were shorter in areas with high human impact, likely owing to changed behaviors and physical limitations. Besides affecting the species themselves, such changes could have wider effects by limiting the movement of nutrients and altering ecological interactions.

          , 
            Animal movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on animal movements have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their movements in areas with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual animals and to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of animals that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission.},

These indirect effects can be propagated by predator consumptive effects on prey, nonconsumptive (risk) effects, or a combination of both. Currently, there is insufﬁcient theory to predict how such predator effects should propagate throughout ecosystems. We present here a theoretical framework for exploring predator effects on ecosystem elemental cycling to encourage further empirical quantiﬁcation. We use a classic ecosystem trophic compartment model as a basis for our analyses but infuse principles from ecological stoichiometry into the analyses of elemental cycling. Using a combined analytical-numerical approach, we compare how predators affect cycling through consumptive effects in which they control the ﬂux of nutrients up trophic chains; through risk effects in which they change the homeostatic elemental balance of herbivore prey which accordingly changes the element ratio herbivores select from plants; and through a combination of both effects. Our analysis reveals that predators can have quantitatively important effects on elemental cycling, relative to a model formalism that excludes predator effects. Furthermore, the feedbacks due to predator nonconsumptive effects often have the quantitatively strongest impact on whole ecosystem elemental stocks, production and efﬁciency rates, and recycling ﬂuxes by changing the stoichiometric balance of all trophic levels. Our modeling framework predictably shows how bottom-up control by microbes and top-down control by predators on ecosystems become interdependent when top predator effects permeate ecosystems.},

              Oncorhynchus
              spp.) in structuring riparian plant communities. A comparison of 50 watersheds in the remote Great Bear Rainforest of British Columbia’s central coast in Canada shows that salmon influence nutrient loading to plants, shifting plant communities toward nutrient-rich species, which in turn decreases plant diversity. These effects are mediated by interactions between salmon density and the physical characteristics of watersheds.

	abstract = {Significance
            Animals play an important role in the transport of nutrients, but this role has diminished because many of the largest animals have gone extinct or experienced massive population declines. Here, we quantify the movement of nutrients by animals in the land, sea, rivers, and air both now and prior to their widespread reductions. The capacity to move nutrients away from hotspots decreased to 6\% of past values across land and ocean. The vertical movement of phosphorus (P) by marine mammals was reduced by 77\% and movement of P from sea to land by seabirds and anadromous fish was reduced by 96\%, effectively disrupting an efficient nutrient distribution pump that once existed from the deep sea to the continental interiors.
          , 
            The past was a world of giants, with abundant whales in the sea and large animals roaming the land. However, that world came to an end following massive late-Quaternary megafauna extinctions on land and widespread population reductions in great whale populations over the past few centuries. These losses are likely to have had important consequences for broad-scale nutrient cycling, because recent literature suggests that large animals disproportionately drive nutrient movement. We estimate that the capacity of animals to move nutrients away from concentration patches has decreased to about 8\% of the preextinction value on land and about 5\% of historic values in oceans. For phosphorus (P), a key nutrient, upward movement in the ocean by marine mammals is about 23\% of its former capacity (previously about 340 million kg of P per year). Movements by seabirds and anadromous fish provide important transfer of nutrients from the sea to land, totalling ∼150 million kg of P per year globally in the past, a transfer that has declined to less than 4\% of this value as a result of the decimation of seabird colonies and anadromous fish populations. We propose that in the past, marine mammals, seabirds, anadromous fish, and terrestrial animals likely formed an interlinked system recycling nutrients from the ocean depths to the continental interiors, with marine mammals moving nutrients from the deep sea to surface waters, seabirds and anadromous fish moving nutrients from the ocean to land, and large animals moving nutrients away from hotspots into the continental interior.},

Marine mammals moved nutrients vertically to the surface, increasing productivity. This increased surface productivity increased available food for seabirds and anadromous fish, potentially increasing the flux of nutrients from sea to land. Finally, on longer time scales, coastal seabird island nutrient hotspots may become exposed to terrestrial fauna and spread toward continental interiors. For instance, most seabird islands are on the continental shelves, which become connected to the continent during interglacial periods, thus exposing the nutrient hotspots to terrestrial animals. Each step is potentially a nonlinear positive feedback of increasing productivity

New research is beginning to show that predator effects on nutrient cycling are ubiquitous.

To address this uncertainty, we compared arthropod predator–prey stoichiometries derived from a compiled database with those from a natural Spartina saltmarsh community. Separate assessments of potential N-limitation were made for arthropod predators feeding on herbivores and for intraguild predators feeding on intraguild prey. Relative to the compiled database, saltmarsh consumer–resource interactions exhibited increased disparity between N-content of herbivores and N-demand by predators. The high N content of saltmarsh arachnids relative to predatory insects at large may contribute to the supply-demand disparity. Whether N-limitation of terrestrial arthropod predators is widespread in the marsh, and in nature in general, depends sensitively on the predatory speciesÕ gross growth efficiencies for N and carbon. Obtaining hard empirical data for these efficiency parameters should be a research goal.},

Systems with more easily digested plants promote stronger cascades (expected). 
Higher nutrient:carbon ratio of plants do not promote stronger cascades, largely because of the net result of ecosystem feedbacks. 
Still, the model with dynamic stoichiometry permits positive correlations of realized plant nutrient:carbon ratio and cascade strength (as predicted), mediated through digestion resistance. 
Third, lower nutrient:carbon ratio of herbivores promotes stronger cascades. 
Finally, we found that predation promotes nutrient limitation of herbivores.

	abstract = {Ecologists have long searched for structures and processes that impart stability in nature. In particular, food web ecology has held promise in tackling this issue. Empirical patterns in food webs have consistently shown that the distributions of species and interactions in nature are more likely to be stable than randomly constructed systems with the same number of species and interactions. Food web ecology still faces two fundamental challenges, however. First, the quantity and quality of food web data required to document both the species richness and the interaction strengths among all species within food webs is largely prohibitive. Second, where food webs have been well documented, spatial and temporal variation in food web structure has been ignored. Conversely, research that has addressed spatial and temporal variation in ecosystems has generally ignored the full complexity of food web architecture. Here, we incorporate empirical patterns, largely from macroecology and behavioural ecology, into a spatially implicit food web structure to construct a simple landscape theory of food web architecture. Such an approach both captures important architectural features of food webs and allows for an exploration of food web structure across a range of spatial scales. Finally, we demonstrated that food webs are hierarchically organized along the spatial and temporal niche axes of species and their utilization of food resources in ways that stabilize ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Biotic connectivity between ecosystems can provide major transport of organic matter and nutrients, influencing ecosystem structure and productivity1, yet the implications are poorly understood owing to human disruptions of natural flows2. When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora3,4. Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (δ15N) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of δ15N were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48\% greater overall biomass. Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean.},

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that the release of nutrients by herbivores via their waste products strongly impacts nutrient availability for autotrophs. The ratios of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) recycled through herbivore release (i.e., waste N:P) are mainly determined by the stoichiometric composition of the herbivore’s food (food N:P) and its body nutrient content (body N:P). Waste N:P can in turn impact autotroph nutrient limitation and productivity. Herbivore-driven nutrient recycling based on stoichiometric principles is dominated by theoretical and experimental research in freshwater systems, in particular interactions between algae and invertebrate herbivores. In terrestrial ecosystems, the impact of herbivores on nutrient cycling and availability is often limited to studying carbon (C):N and C:P ratios, while the role of terrestrial herbivores in mediating N:P ratios is also likely to inﬂuence herbivore-driven nutrient recycling. In this review, we use rules and predictions on the stoichiometry of nutrient release originating from algal-based aquatic systems to identify the factors that determine the stoichiometry of nutrient release by herbivores. We then explore how these rules can be used to understand the stoichiometry of nutrient release by terrestrial herbivores, ranging from invertebrates to mammals, and its impact on plant nutrient limitation and productivity. Future studies should focus on measuring both N and P when investigating herbivore-driven nutrient recycling in terrestrial ecosystems, while also taking the form of waste product (urine or feces) and other pathways by which herbivores change nutrients into account, to be able to quantify the impact of waste stoichiometry on plant communities.},

This is, however, far from a uniform pattern, and there is a recognized need to investigate any interactive effects of herbivory and habitat fertility (i.e., plant C/N ratios) on soil nutrient availabilities. We determined long-term effects of reindeer on soil extractable nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and their net mineralization rates along a fertility gradient of plant carbon (C) to N and P ratios in arctic tundra. Our results showed that reindeer had a positive effect on soil N in the more nutrient-poor sites and a negative effect on soil P in the more nutrient-rich sites, which contrasts from the general consensus. The increase in N availability was linked to a decrease in plant and litter C/N ratios, suggesting that a shift in vegetation composition toward more graminoids favors higher N cycling. Soil P availability was not as closely linked to the vegetation and is likely regulated more by herbivore-induced changes in soil physical and chemical properties. The changes in soil extractable N and P resulted in higher soil N/P ratios, suggesting that reindeer could drive the vegetation toward P-limitation. This research highlights the importance of including both the elements N and P and conducting studies along environmental gradients in order to better understand the interactive effects of herbivory and habitat fertility on nutrient cycling and primary production.},

Their top-down role through selective feeding on either trees or grasses is well studied, but their bottom-up role through deposition of nutrients in dung and urine has been overlooked. Here, we propose a novel concept of savanna ecosystem functioning in which the balance between trees and grasses is maintained through stoichiometric differences in dung of herbivores that feed on them. We describe a framework in which N2-fixing trees and grasses, as well as ungulate browsing and grazing herbivores, occupy opposite positions in an interconnected cycle of processes. The framework makes the testable assumption that the differences in dung N:P ratio among browsers and grazers are large enough to influence competitive interactions between N2-fixing trees and grasses. Other key elements of our concept are supported with field data from a Kenyan savanna.},

Challenging this view, we demonstrate that in an individual-based model, microbial community dynamics alter relative C and N limitation during litter decomposition, leading to a system behaviour not predictable from stoichiometric theory alone. Rather, the dynamics of interacting functional groups lead to an adaptation at the community level, which accelerates nitrogen recycling in litter with high initial C : N ratios and thus alleviates microbial N limitation. This mechanism allows microbial decomposers to overcome large imbalances between resource and biomass stoichiometry without the need to decrease carbon use efﬁciency (CUE), which is in contrast to predictions of traditional stoichiometric mass balance equations. We conclude that identifying and implementing microbial community-driven mechanisms in biogeochemical models are necessary for accurately predicting terrestrial C ﬂuxes in response to changing environmental conditions.},

Desertiﬁcation affects large dryland areas around the world and is a major cause of stress in human societies. Here we review recent research on the drivers, feedbacks, and impacts of desertiﬁcation. A multidisciplinary approach to understanding the drivers and feedbacks of global desertiﬁcation is motivated by our increasing need to improve global food production and to sustainably manage ecosystems in the context of climate change. Classic desertiﬁcation theories look at this process as a transition between stable states in bistable ecosystem dynamics. Climate change (i.e., aridiﬁcation) and land use dynamics are the major drivers of an ecosystem shift to a ‘‘desertiﬁed’’ (or ‘‘degraded’’) state. This shift is typically sustained by positive feedbacks, which stabilize the system in the new state. Desertiﬁcation feedbacks may involve land degradation processes (e.g., nutrient loss or salinization), changes in rainfall regime resulting from land-atmosphere interactions (e.g., precipitation recycling, dust emissions), or changes in plant community composition (e.g., shrub encroachment, decrease in vegetation cover). We analyze each of these feedback mechanisms and discuss their possible enhancement by interactions with socio-economic drivers. Large scale effects of desertiﬁcation include the emigration of ‘‘environmental refugees’’ displaced from degraded areas, climatic changes, and the alteration of global biogeochemical cycles resulting from the emission and long-range transport of ﬁne mineral dust. Recent research has identiﬁed some possible early warning signs of desertiﬁcation, which can be used as indicators of resilience loss and imminent shift to desert-like conditions. We conclude with a brief discussion on some desertiﬁcation control strategies implemented in different regions around the world.},

We discuss pros and cons, assumptions and limitations of diﬀerent approaches used for inferring plant–plant networks.
Conclusions: We propose novel opportunities for advancing plant ecology by using ecological networks that encompass diﬀerent ecological levels and spatio-temporal scales, and incorporate more biological information.

Co-occurrence data are increasingly used to infer biotic interactions, but their accuracy remains poorly studied. We hypothesize that the predictions of biotic interactions based on co-occurrence networks are scale-dependent, being more accurate when co-occurrence is sampled at the spatial scale at which biotic interactions occur. We studied a plant community in a semi-arid gypsum environment, where plant-plant interactions result in a clumped distribution of the vegetation, which allows a straightforward identiﬁcation of the scale at which interactions occur (i.e. vegetation patches). We used Bayesian network inferences to detect co-occurrence patterns at two spatial scales (patches of about 0.05 m2 and plots of 2.25 m2), and measured plant-plant interactions based on the eﬀects of plant species on the establishment and recruitment of their neigbours. The co-occurrence network inferred at the patch scale did not reﬂect the plant-plant interactions observed, and the networks inferred at two diﬀerent spatial scales showed contrasted topologies.

	abstract = {Co-occurrence methods are increasingly utilized in ecology to infer networks of species interactions where detailed knowledge based on empirical studies is difficult to obtain. Their use is particularly common, but not restricted to, microbial networks constructed from metagenomic analyses. In this study, we test the efficacy of this procedure by comparing an inferred network constructed using spatially intensive co-occurrence data from the rocky intertidal zone in central Chile to a well-resolved, empirically-based, species interaction network from the same region. We evaluated the overlap in the information provided by each network and whether there is a bias for co-occurrence data to better detect known trophic or non-trophic, positive or negative interactions. We found a poor correspondence between the cooccurrence network and the known species interactions with overall sensitivity (probability of true link detection) equal to 0.469, and specificity (true non-interaction) equal to 0.527. The ability to detect interactions varied with interaction type. Positive non-trophic interactions such as commensalism and facilitation were detected at the highest rates. These results demonstrate that co-occurrence networks do not represent well classical ecological networks in which interactions are defined by direct observations or experimental manipulations. Co-occurrence networks provide information about the joint spatial effects of environmental conditions, recruitment, and, to some extent, biotic interactions, and among the latter, they tend to better detect niche-expanding interactions such as positive non-trophic interactions including habitat engineering. Detection of links (sensitivity or specificity) was not higher for well-known intertidal keystone species than for the rest of consumers in the community. Thus, as observed in previous empirical and theoretical studies, patterns of interactions in co-occurrence networks must be interpreted with caution, especially when extending interaction-based ecological theory to interpret network variability and stability. Co-occurrence networks may be particularly valuable for analysis of community dynamics that blends interactions and environment, rather than pairwise interactions alone.},

Although communities acquire emerging properties when many species interact, most of our knowledge about facilitation is based on studies between pairs of species. To understand how plant facilitation preserves biodiversity in complex ecological communities, we propose to move from the study of pairwise interactions to the network approach. We show that facilitation networks behave as mutualistic networks do, characterized by a nonrandom, nested structure of plant-plant interactions in which a few generalist nurses facilitate a large number of species while the rest of the nurses facilitate only a subset of them. Consequently, generalist nurses shape a dense and highly connected network. Interestingly, such generalist nurses are the most abundant species in the community, making facilitation-shaped communities strongly resistant to extinction, as revealed by coextinction simulations. The nested structure of facilitative networks explains why facilitation, by preventing extinction, preserves biodiversity.},

	abstract = {In semi-arid ecosystems, vegetation is heterogeneously distributed, with plant species often associating in patches. These associations between species are not constant, but depend on the particular response of each species to environmental factors. Here, we investigated how plant species associations change in response to livestock grazing in a semi-arid ecosystem, Cabo de Gata-N´ıjar Natural Park in South East Spain. We established linear point-intercept transects at four sites with different grazing intensity, and recorded all species at each point. We investigated plant associations by comparing the number of times that each pair of species occurred at the same spatial point (co-occurrences), with the expected number of times based on species abundances. We also assessed associations for each shrub and grass species by considering all their pairs of associations and for the whole plant community by considering all pairs of associations on each site. At all sites, the plant community had a negative pattern of association, with fewer co-occurrences than expected. Negative association in the plant community increased at maximum grazing intensity. Most species associated as expected, particularly grass species, and positive associations were most important at intermediate grazing intensities. No species changed its type of association along the grazing gradient. We conclude that in the present plant community, grazing-resistant species compete among themselves and segregate in space. Some shrub species act as refuges for grazing-sensitive species that benefit from being spatially associated with shrub species, particularly at intermediate grazing intensities where positive associations were highest. At high grazing intensity, these shrubs can no longer persist and positive associations decrease due to the disappearance of refuges. Spatial associations between plant species and their response to grazing help identify the factors that organize plant communities, and may contribute to improving management of semi-arid ecosystems.},

              Regime shifts can abruptly affect hydrological, climatic and terrestrial systems, leading to degraded ecosystems and impoverished societies.

Each additional unit area of an ecosystem provides an increasingly smaller unit of time taken for that system to collapse, meaning that large systems tend to shift more slowly than small systems but disproportionately faster. We substantiate these findings with five computational models that reveal the importance of system structure in controlling shift duration. The findings imply that shifts in Earth ecosystems occur over ‘human’ timescales of years and decades, meaning the collapse of large vulnerable ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest and Caribbean coral reefs, may take only a few decades once triggered.},

These processes have focused almost exclusively on habitat ﬁltering and competitive exclusion. Recent evidence, however, indicates that facilitation has been important in preserving biodiversity over evolutionary time, with recent lineages conserving the regeneration niches of older, distant lineages. Here we test whether, if facilitation among distantrelated species has preserved the regeneration niche of plant lineages, this has increased the phylogenetic diversity of communities. By analyzing a large worldwide database of species, we showed that the regeneration niches were strongly conserved across evolutionary history. Likewise, a phylogenetic supertree of all species of three communities driven by facilitation showed that nurse species facilitated distantly related species and increased phylogenetic diversity.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            The root mycobiome plays a fundamental role in plant nutrition and protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. In temperate forests or meadows dominated by angiosperms, the numerous fungi involved in root symbioses are often shared between neighboring plants, thus forming complex plant-fungus interaction networks of weak specialization. Whether this weak specialization also holds in rich tropical communities with more phylogenetically diverse sets of plant lineages remains unknown.
            We collected roots of 30 plant species in semi-natural tropical communities including angiosperms, ferns, and lycophytes, in three different habitat types on La Réunion island: a recent lava flow, a wet thicket, and an ericoid shrubland. We identified root-inhabiting fungi by sequencing both the 18S rRNA and the ITS2 variable regions. We assessed the diversity of mycorrhizal fungal taxa according to plant species and lineages, as well as the structure and specialization of the resulting plant-fungus networks.
          
          
            Results
            
              The 18S and ITS2 datasets are highly complementary at revealing the root mycobiota. According to 18S,
              Glomeromycotina
              colonize all plant groups in all habitats forming the least specialized interactions, resulting in nested network structures, while
              Mucoromycotina
              (
              Endogonales
              ) are more abundant in the wetland and show higher specialization and modularity compared to the former. According to ITS2, mycorrhizal fungi of
              Ericaceae
              and
              Orchidaceae
              ,
              namely Helotiales
              ,
              Sebacinales
              , and
              Cantharellales
              , also colonize the roots of most plant lineages, confirming that they are frequent endophytes. While
              Helotiales
              and
              Sebacinales
              present intermediate levels of specialization,
              Cantharellales
              are more specialized and more sporadic in their interactions with plants, resulting in highly modular networks.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            
              This study of the root mycobiome in tropical environments reinforces the idea that mycorrhizal fungal taxa are locally shared between co-occurring plants, including phylogenetically distant plants (
              e.g.
              lycophytes and angiosperms), where they may form functional mycorrhizae or establish endophytic colonization. Yet, we demonstrate that, irrespectively of the environmental variations, the level of specialization significantly varies according to the fungal lineages, probably reflecting the different evolutionary origins of these plant-fungus symbioses. Frequent fungal sharing between plants questions the roles of the different fungi in community functioning and highlights the importance of considering networks of interactions rather than isolated hosts.},

In this paper, I systematically compare the performance of nine null model algorithms and four co-occurrence indices with respect to Type I and Type II errors. The nine algorithms differ in whether rows and columns are treated as fixed sums, equiprobable, or proportional. The three models that maintain fixed row sums are invulnerable to Type I errors (false positives). One of these three is a modified version of the original algorithm of E. F Connor and D. Simberloff. Of the four co-occurrence indices, the number of checkerboard combinations and the number of species combinations may be prone to Type II errors (false negatives), and may not reveal significant patterns in noisy data sets. L. Stone and A. Robert's checkerboard score has good power for detecting species pairs that do not cooccur together frequently, whereas D. Schluter's V ratio reveals nonrandom patterns in the row and column totals of the matrix. Degenerate matrices (matrices with empty rows or columns) do not greatly alter the outcome of null model analyses. The choice of an appropriate null model and index may depend on whether the data represent classic "island lists" of species in an archipelago or standardized "sample lists" of species collected with equal sampling effort. Systematic examination of a set of related null models can pinpoint how violation of the assumptions of the model contributes to nonrandom patterns.},

While much recent research has focused on self-organised vegetation the prevailing view is still that biological patchiness is mostly due to top-down control by the physical landscape template, disturbances or predators. We suggest that vegetation patchiness in real landscapes is controlled both by the physical template and by self-organisation simultaneously, and introduce a conceptual model for the relative roles of the two mechanisms. The model considers four factors that control whether vegetation patchiness is emerged or imposed: soil patch size, plant size, resource input and resource availability. The last three factors determine the plant-patch size, and the plant-to-soil patch size ratio determines the impact of self-organisation, which becomes important when this ratio is sufﬁciently small. A ﬁeld study and numerical simulations of a mathematical model support the conceptual model and give further insight by providing examples of self-organised and template-controlled vegetation patterns co-occurring in the same landscape. We conclude that real landscapes are generally mixtures of template-induced and selforganised patchiness. Patchiness variability increases due to source–sink resource relations, and decreases for species of larger patch sizes.},

We used an individual-based model to demonstrate that plant facilitation on a microscale may cause ecosystem shifts on a landscape scale that can be announced by generic earlywarning indicators. Recruitment of woody plants in harsh environments such as drylands often depends on nurse plants that ameliorate stressful conditions and facilitate the establishment of seedlings under their canopy. We found that these facilitative interactions may cause a treeless and a woodland state to be alternative stable states on a landscape scale if nurse plant effects are strong and if the environment is harsh enough to make facilitation necessary for seedling survival. A corollary is that under such conditions environmental change can bring drylands to tipping points for woody plant encroachment or woodland collapse. We show that the proximity of tipping points may be indicated by slowness of recovery of woody vegetation cover from small perturbations as well as by elevated temporal and spatial autocorrelation and variance. These signs are known to be indicators of critical slowing down. This is the ﬁrst demonstration that the systemic phenomena of tipping points, announced by critical slowing down as a warning signal, may plausibly arise from microscale individual interactions, such as plant facilitation.},

	abstract = {Positive plant–plant interactions (i.e. facilitation) receive increasing attention as a potentially important driver of community assembly. We conducted a systematic literature review indicating broad support for positive effects of potential facilitator species. However, a large majority of the reviewed studies (83\% for ﬁeld studies, 57\% for experiments) share a similar risk of misinterpretation as they assess facilitative effects by comparing plots inhabited by a potential facilitator with randomly placed control plots nearby (paired sampling). As the distribution of facilitator species may itself be environmentally driven, species co-existence caused by facilitation cannot exclusively be separated from environmental effects (habitat sharing). Based on simulated plant communities and sampling protocols, we show how non-random co-existence can occur in the absence of facilitation. This is relevant because both the effect of spatial environmental heterogeneity and of facilitation (stress-gradient hypothesis) are expected to increase with environmental harshness. Nevertheless, 58\% of facilitation studies neither undertook measures to minimize potential biases in their sampling approaches nor did they acknowledge such limitations in the discussion. Attention to this problem has signiﬁcantly decreased in recent years. We propose that facilitation studies could be improved by (1) using random sampling for association studies, (2) co-analysing environmental factors, or (3) experimentally establishing presumed facilitators. Experimental approaches mimicking facilitative plant characteristics can help to identify facilitation mechanisms. Combining approaches and including functional traits of the involved species should further strengthen inference.},

            Biodiversity is driven by complex associations among species, but ecologists often look only at competitive or facilitative interactions either independently or only for few species at a time. Using a large dataset of mountain ecosystems encompassing more than 2,000 species across the globe, we analyze the prevalence and importance of both positive and negative associations among plants. Our findings indicate that facilitation and competition between plant species must be studied together in order to explain biodiversity change.
          , 
            Biological diversity depends on multiple, cooccurring ecological interactions. However, most studies focus on one interaction type at a time, leaving community ecologists unsure of how positive and negative associations among species combine to influence biodiversity patterns. Using surveys of plant populations in alpine communities worldwide, we explore patterns of positive and negative associations among triads of species (modules) and their relationship to local biodiversity. Three modules, each incorporating both positive and negative associations, were overrepresented, thus acting as "network motifs." Furthermore, the overrepresentation of these network motifs is positively linked to species diversity globally. A theoretical model illustrates that these network motifs, based on competition between facilitated species or facilitation between inferior competitors, increase local persistence. Our findings suggest that the interplay of competition and facilitation is crucial for maintaining biodiversity.},

One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that outcompetes both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known interactions, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. Markov networks consistently outperformed the other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, which controlled for indirect effects with partial correlations or generalized linear models, also performed well. Null models showed no evidence of being able to control for indirect effects, and reliably yielded incorrect inferences when such effects were present.},

	abstract = {Theoretical models predict that the net outcome of biotic interactions among plants is the sum of co-occurring negative and positive interactions, with facilitation generally increasing in importance with increasing abiotic stress. However, species differ in fundamental niche optima; thus the intensity of stress is relative among species and important only in the context of these relative differences. We tested the hypothesis that the facilitative response of a species is relative to how much abiotic conditions deviate from the optimum conditions for that particular species (stress), and the competitive "response" ability of the species (i.e., its ability to tolerate the inhibitory effects of neighbors). In a field experiment, we examined the responses of three co-occurring species with different ecological optima, Bromus erectus, Brachypodium rupestre, and Arrhenatherum elatius, to the alleviation of a primary limiting resource (water), and to biotic interactions in a mesoxeric grassland in eastern France. We found that A. elatius had a strong positive response to watering, the response of B. rupestre was moderately positive, and B. erectus did not respond significantly, suggesting that water stress was only important for the first two species. Most importantly, the net outcome of the interaction between each species and its neighbors depended on the degree of water stress it experienced in its natural habitat. For survival, in the control plots we found no significant interactions for B. erectus (not stressed) whereas B. rupestre and A. elatius (stressed species) were facilitated. Enhancing water availability suppressed facilitation of B. rupestre and A. elatius and led to competitive exclusion of B. erectus. In contrast to survival, there was no facilitation for growth in the control plots, and competition intensity increased for all three species with watering. In our experiment the competitive response of a species was inverse to its ability to tolerate stress, indicating a trade-off between these components of the species response. A facilitative outcome appears to be a function of a species having both a low tolerance to a particular abiotic stress and a strong competitive-response ability.

The distribution of these modes is consistent with the often hypothesized forest-­savanna bistability and suggests that both states can be stable in areas with a mean annual precipitation between {\textasciitilde}1,500 and {\textasciitilde}2,000 mm. Although the canopy height states correspond largely to the much discussed tree cover states, there are differences, too. For instance, there are places with savanna-l­ike sparse tree cover that have a forest-l­ike high canopy, suggesting that rather than true savanna, those are thinned relicts of forest. This illustrates how complementary sets of remotely sensed indicators may provide increasingly sophisticated ways to study ecological phenomena at a global scale.},

	abstract = {Self-organized spatial patterns of vegetation are frequent in water-limited regions and have been suggested as important indicators of ecosystem health. However, the mechanisms underlying their emergence remain unclear. Some theories hypothesize that patterns could result from a watermediated scale-dependent feedback (SDF), whereby interactions favoring plant growth dominate at short distances and growth-inhibitory interactions dominate in the long range. However, we know little about how net plant-to-plant interactions may shift from positive to negative as a function of inter-individual distance, and in the absence of strong empirical support, the relevance of this SDF for vegetation pattern formation remains disputed. These theories predict a sequential change in pattern shape from gapped to labyrinthine to spotted spatial patterns as precipitation declines. Nonetheless, alternative theories show that the same sequence of patterns could emerge even if net interactions between plants were always inhibitory (purely competitive feedbacks, PCF). Importantly, although these alternative hypotheses lead to visually indistinguishable patterns they predict very diﬀerent desertiﬁcation dynamics following the spotted pattern, limiting their potential use as an ecosystem-state indicator. Moreover, vegetation interaction with other ecosystem components can introduce additional spatio-temporal scales that reshape both the patterns and the desertiﬁcation dynamics. Therefore, to make reliable ecological predictions for a focal ecosystem, it is crucial that models accurately capture the mechanisms at play in the system of interest. Here, we review existing theories for vegetation self-organization and their conﬂicting predictions about desertiﬁcation dynamics. We further discuss possible ways for reconciling these predictions and potential empirical tests via manipulative experiments to improve our understanding of how vegetation self-organizes and better predict the fate of the ecosystems where they form.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Ecosystem services derive from ecosystem functions and rely on complex interactions among a diversity of organisms. By understanding the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and the services humans receive from nature, we can anticipate how changes in land use will affect ecosystems and human wellbeing. We show that increasing land-use intensity homogenizes the synergies between three organizational levels of the ecosystem, namely, biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services. Increasing land-use intensity changes keystone components, which are important for the functioning of the ecosystem, and alters the synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services. Our approach provides a comprehensive view of ecosystem functioning and can identify the key ecosystem attributes to monitor in order to prevent critical shifts in ecosystems.
          , 
            Land-use intensification can increase provisioning ecosystem services, such as food and timber production, but it also drives changes in ecosystem functioning and biodiversity loss, which may ultimately compromise human wellbeing. To understand how changes in land-use intensity affect the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services, we built networks from correlations between the species richness of 16 trophic groups, 10 ecosystem functions, and 15 ecosystem services. We evaluated how the properties of these networks varied across land-use intensity gradients for 150 forests and 150 grasslands. Land-use intensity significantly affected network structure in both habitats. Changes in connectance were larger in forests, while changes in modularity and evenness were more evident in grasslands. Our results show that increasing land-use intensity leads to more homogeneous networks with less integration within modules in both habitats, driven by the belowground compartment in grasslands, while forest responses to land management were more complex. Land-use intensity strongly altered hub identity and module composition in both habitats, showing that the positive correlations of provisioning services with biodiversity and ecosystem functions found at low land-use intensity levels, decline at higher intensity levels. Our approach provides a comprehensive view of the relationships between multiple components of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and ecosystem services and how they respond to land use. This can be used to identify overall changes in the ecosystem, to derive mechanistic hypotheses, and it can be readily applied to further global change drivers.},

	abstract = {Since proposed two decades ago, the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH), suggesting that species interactions shift from competition to facilitation with stress, has been widely examined. Despite broad support across species and ecosystems, ecologists debate whether the SGH applies to extreme environments, arguing that species interactions switch to competition or collapse under extreme stress. We show that facilitation often expands distributions on species borders. SGH exceptions occur when weak stress gradients or stresses outside of species’ niches are examined, multiple stresses co-occur canceling out their effects, temporally dependent effects are involved, or results are improperly analyzed. We suggest that ecologists resolve debates by standardizing key SGH terms, such as fundamental and realized niche, stress gradients vs. environmental gradients, by quantitatively deﬁning extreme stress, and by critically evaluating the functionality of stress gradients. We also suggest that new research examine the breadth and relevance of the SGH. More rigor needs to be applied to SGH tests to identify actual exceptions rather than those due to failures to meet its underlying assumptions, so that the general principles of the SGH and its exceptions can be incorporated into ecological theory, conservation strategies, and environmental change predictions.},

However, the origin of such diversity and the consequences of food web complexity in both species abundances and temporal fluctuations are not well understood. Several regularities are observed in complex, multispecies ecosystems that suggest that these ecologies might be organized close to points of instability. We explore, in greater depth, a recent stochastic model of population dynamics that is shown to reproduce: (i) the scaling law linking species number and connectivity; (ii) the observed distributions of species abundance reported from field studies (showing long tails and thus a predominance of rare species); (iii) the complex fluctuations displayed by natural communities (including chaotic dynamics); and (iv) the species–area relations displayed by rainforest plots. It is conjectured that the conflict between the natural tendency towards higher diversity due to immigration, and the ecosystem level constraints derived from an increasing number of links, leaves the system poised at a critical boundary separating stable from unstable communities, where large fluctuations are expected to occur. We suggest that the patterns displayed by species–rich communities, including rarity, would result from such a spontaneous tendency towards instability.},

During this time, a wave of new plant species emerged, presumably in response to the new climate. Interestingly, most Tertiary species that have been tracked through the fossil record did not disappear but remained relatively abundant despite the development of a much more unfavorable climate for species adapted to moist conditions. Here we find, by integrating paleobotanical, ecological, and phylogenetic analyses, that a large number of ancient Tertiary species in Mediterranean-climate ecosystems appear to have been preserved by the facilitative or “nurse” effects of modern Quaternary species. Our results indicate that these interdependent relationships among plants have played a central role in the preservation of the global biodiversity and provided a mechanism for stabilizing selection and the conservation of ecological traits over evolutionary time scales.},

Here, we assembled a global database of 10,502 pairs of empirical data from the literature to address the patterns of and climatic effects on the net outcome of plant interactions in natural communities. We found that plant interactions varied among plant performance indicators, interaction types and biomes, yet competition occurred more frequently than facilitation in plant communities worldwide. Unexpectedly, plant interactions showed weak latitudinal pattern and were weakly related to climate. Our study provides a global comprehensive overview of plant interactions, highlighting competition as a fundamental mechanism structuring plant communities worldwide. We suggest that further investigations should focus more on local factors (e.g. microclimate, soil and disturbance) than on macroclimate to identify key environmental determinants of interactions in plant communities.},

The combined effect of drought stress and grazing disturbance on shaping plant–plant interactions is still poorly understood, while this combination is common in semiarid ecosystems. Four species including Stipa grandis, which is dominant in the typical steppe, and Stipa krylovii, Artemisia frigida, and Cleistogenes squarrosa, which are dominant species in the S. grandis degraded communities, were selected as study targets. We conducted a competition experiment (uniformly dense monoculture or mixture, respectively) under controlled conditions, including both drought stress and mowing disturbance, and calculated the relative interaction index (RII) of tiller number and RII of biomass for each species under each condition. (a) Under the same condition, the RII of tiller number and that of biomass for the same species usually showed reverse trends. (b) Mowing disturbance rather than drought stress played a negative role in influencing S. grandis’ or S. krylovii’s RII of tiller number and played a positive role in influencing A. frigida’s RII of biomass. (c) Drought stress rather than mowing disturbance played a positive role in influencing C. squarrosa’s RII of tiller number. (d) Neighbor species significantly influenced S. grandis’ RII of tiller number, S. krylovii’s RII of tiller number, A. frigida’s RII of tiller number and biomass, and C. squarrosa’s RII of biomass. These results could provide an explanation for why S. krylovii, A. frigida, and C. squarrosa can replace S. grandis and become the dominant species when S. grandis communities undergo a process of degradation due to overgrazing or climatic drought in natural communities. The present study provided powerful evidences for species replacement in the typical steppe of Inner Mongolia and elucidated the driving mechanisms of S. grandis communities’ retrogressive succession.},

In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent ﬁnding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.},

            Many climate subsystems are thought to be susceptible to tipping—and some might be close to a tipping point. The general belief and intuition, based on simple conceptual models of tipping elements, is that tipping leads to reorganization of the full (sub)system. Here, we explore tipping in conceptual, but spatially extended and spatially heterogenous models. These are extensions of conceptual models taken from all sorts of climate system components on multiple spatial scales. By analysis of the bifurcation structure of such systems, special stable equilibrium states are revealed: coexistence states with part of the spatial domain in one state, and part in another, with a spatial interface between these regions. These coexistence states critically depend on the size and the spatial heterogeneity of the (sub)system. In particular, in these systems the crossing of a tipping point not necessarily leads to a full reorganization of the system. Instead, it might lead to a reorganization of only part of the spatial domain, limiting the impact of these events on the system’s functioning.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems’ responses to changing environmental conditions can be modulated by spatial self-organization. A prominent example of this can be found in drylands, where formation of vegetation patterns attenuates the magnitude of degradation events in response to decreasing rainfall. In model studies, the pattern wavelength responds to changing conditions, which is reﬂected by a rather gradual decline in biomass in response to decreasing rainfall. Although these models are spatially explicit, they have adopted a mean-ﬁeld approach to grazing. By taking into account spatial variability when modeling grazing, we ﬁnd that (over)grazing can lead to a dramatic shift in biomass, so that degradation occurs at rainfall rates that would otherwise still maintain a relatively productive ecosystem. Moreover, grazing increases the resilience of degraded ecosystem states. Consequently, restoration of degraded ecosystems could beneﬁt from the introduction of temporary small-scale exclosures to escape from the basin of attraction of degraded states.},

	abstract = {Identifying interspecific associations is very important for understanding the community assembly process. However, most methods provide only an average association and assume that the association strength does not vary along the environmental gradient or with time. The scale effects are generally ignored. We integrated the idea of wavelet and network topological analysis to provide a novel way to detect nonrandom species associations across scales and along gradients using continuous or presence–absence ecological data. We first used a simulated species distribution data set to illustrate how the wavelet correlation analysis builds an association matrix and demonstrates its statistical robustness. Then, we applied the wavelet correlation network to a presence–absence data set of soil invertebrates. We found that the associations of invertebrates varied along an altitudinal gradient. We conclude by discussing several possible extensions of this method, such as predicting community assembly, utility in the temporal dimension, and the shifting effects of highly connected species within a community. The combination of the multiscale decomposition of wavelet and network topology analysis has great potential for fostering an understanding of the assembly and succession of communities, as well as predicting their responses to future climate change across spatial or temporal scales.},

This study examined the effects of livestock grazing on plant communities in arid steppe rangelands of North Africa. Plant diversity of annual species, perennial species, and all species combined were measured and compared between grazed and grazing-excluded areas. We also examined the relative importance of species turnover and community nestedness. Moreover, the effects of livestock grazing on beta diversity at local among transects and landscape among sites scales were examined using the multiplicative diversity partitioning. Results revealed that livestock grazing significantly decreased the alpha diversity of all species combined and the diversity of annual plants. Livestock grazing induced a shift in plant community composition where most species composition variation ( 74\%) was due to infrequent species replacement 'turnover' between the two management types rather than nestedness ( 26\%). Results revealed also that among transects, beta diversity was higher in grazed steppes than in grazing-excluded steppes. Whereas, among sites, beta diversity was lower in grazed steppes compared to grazing-excluded steppes. These findings suggest that livestock grazing in arid steppe rangelands increases the variation in plant species composition at a local spatial scale and engenders vegetation homogeneity at a landscape spatial scale. Therefore, the implementation of appropriate management practices such as short-term grazing exclusion is mandatory to prevent these ecosystems from large-scale biotic homogenization.},

In this paper, I systematically compare the performance of nine null model algorithms and four co-occurrence indices with respect to Type I and Type II errors. The nine algorithms differ in whether rows and columns are treated as fixed sums, equiprobable, or proportional. The three models that maintain fixed row sums are invulnerable to Type I errors (false positives). One of these three is a modified version of the original algorithm of E. F Connor and D. Simberloff. Of the four co-occurrence indices, the number of checkerboard combinations and the number of species combinations may be prone to Type II errors (false negatives), and may not reveal significant patterns in noisy data sets. L. Stone and A. Robert's checkerboard score has good power for detecting species pairs that do not cooccur together frequently, whereas D. Schluter's V ratio reveals nonrandom patterns in the row and column totals of the matrix. Degenerate matrices (matrices with empty rows or columns) do not greatly alter the outcome of null model analyses. The choice of an appropriate null model and index may depend on whether the data represent classic "island lists" of species in an archipelago or standardized "sample lists" of species collected with equal sampling effort. Systematic examination of a set of related null models can pinpoint how violation of the assumptions of the model contributes to nonrandom patterns.},

To shed light upon this question, we used a network approach to analyse the drivers of species co-occurrence patterns. In particular, we focus on the potential roles of body size and trophic status as determinants of metacommunity cohesion because of their link to resource use and dispersal ability. Small-sized individuals at low-trophic levels, and with limited dispersal potential, are expected to form highly linked subgroups, whereas large-size individuals at higher trophic positions, and with good dispersal potential, will foster the spatial coupling of subgroups and the cohesion of the whole metacommunity. By using modularity analysis, we identified six modules of species with similar responses to ecological conditions and high co-occurrence across local communities. Most species either co-occur with species from a single module or are connectors of the whole network. Among the latter are carnivorous species of intermediate body size, which by virtue of their high incidence provide connectivity to otherwise isolated communities playing the role of spatial couplers. Our study also demonstrates that the incorporation of network tools to the analysis of metacommunity ecology can help unveil the mechanisms underlying patterns and processes in metacommunity assembly.},

	abstract = {A humped-back relationship between species richness and community biomass has frequently been observed in plant communities, at both local and regional scales, although often improperly called a productivity–diversity relationship. Explanations for this relationship have emphasized the role of competitive exclusion, probably because at the time when the relationship was ﬁrst examined, competition was considered to be the signiﬁcant biotic ﬁlter structuring plant communities. However, over the last 15 years there has been a renewed interest in facilitation and this research has shown a clear link between the role of facilitation in structuring communities and both community biomass and the severity of the environment. Although facilitation may enlarge the realized niche of species and increase community richness in stressful environments, there has only been one previous attempt to revisit the humped-back model of species richness and to include facilitative processes. However, to date, no model has explored whether biotic interactions can potentially shape both sides of the humped-back model for species richness commonly detected in plant communities. Here, we propose a revision of Grime’s original model that incorporates a new understanding of the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities. In this revised model, facilitation promotes diversity at medium to high environmental severity levels, by expanding the realized niche of stress-intolerant competitive species into harsh physical conditions. However, when environmental conditions become extremely severe the positive effects of the benefactors wane (as supported by recent research on facilitative interactions in extremely severe environments) and diversity is reduced. Conversely, with decreasing stress along the biomass gradient, facilitation decreases because stress-intolerant species become able to exist away from the canopy of the stress-tolerant species (as proposed by facilitation theory). At the same time competition increases for stress-tolerant species, reducing diversity in the most benign conditions (as proposed by models of competition theory). In this way our inclusion of facilitation into the classic model of plant species diversity and community biomass generates a more powerful and richer predictive framework for understanding the role of plant interactions in changing diversity. We then use our revised model to explain both the observed discrepancies between natural patterns of species richness and community biomass and the results of experimental studies of the impact of biodiversity on the productivity of herbaceous communities. It is clear that explicit consideration of concurrent changes in stress-tolerant and competitive species enhances our capacity to explain and interpret patterns in plant community diversity with respect to environmental severity.},

	abstract = {Alternative stable ecosystem states are possible under the same environmental conditions in many models of 2-3 interacting species and an array of feedback loops. However, multi-species food webs might dissipate the feedbacks that create alternative stable states through species-speciﬁc traits and feedbacks. To test this potential, we develop a manyspecies model of consumer-resource interactions with two classes of feedbacks: specialized feedbacks where individual resources become unpalatable at high abundance, or aggregate feedbacks where overall resource abundance reduces consumer recruitment. We quantify how trophic interconnectedness and species diﬀerences in demography aﬀect the potential for either feedback to produce alternative stable states dominated by consumers or resources. We ﬁnd that alternative stable states are likely to happen in many-species food webs when aggregate feedbacks or lower species diﬀerences increase redundancy in species contributions to persistence of the consumer guild. Conversely, specialized palatability feedbacks with distinctive species roles in consumer guild persistence reduce the potential for alternative states but increase the likelihood that losing vulnerable consumers cascades into a food web collapse at low stress levels, a dynamic absent in few-species models. Altogether, amongspecies trait variation can limit the set of processes that create alternative stable states and impede consumer recovery from disturbance.},

Species trait diversity also affects ecosystem functioning and resilience, yet it remains unknown whether species’ contributions to functional diversity relate to their network roles. Here, we use 21 empirical pollen transport networks to characterise this relationship. We found that, apart from a few abundant species, pollinators with original traits either had few interaction partners or interacted most frequently with a subset of these partners. This suggests that narrowing of interactions to a subset of the plant community accompanies pollinator niche specialisation, congruent with our hypothesised trade-off between having unique traits vs. being able to interact with many mutualist partners. Conversely, these effects were not detected in plants, potentially because key aspects of their ﬂowering traits are conserved at a family level. Relating functional and network roles can provide further insight into mechanisms underlying ecosystem functioning.},

The information contained in such interaction matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exempliﬁed here by modularity, is difﬁcult to link to speciﬁc causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to speciﬁc interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substantial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on ﬁtness consequences as measured in experimental setups.},

	abstract = {Plant adaptation to drought has been extensively studied at many scales from ecology to molecular biology across a large range of model species. However, the conceptual frameworks underpinning the definition of plant strategies, and the terminology used across the different disciplines and scales are not analogous. ‘Drought resistance’ for instance refers to plant responses as different as the maintenance of growth and productivity in crops, to the survival and recovery in perennial woody or grassland species. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a unified conceptual framework of plant adaptive strategies to drought based on a revised terminology in order to enhance comparative studies. Ecological strategies encapsulate plant adaptation to multidimensional variation in resource variability but cannot account for the dynamic and short-term responses to fluctuations in water availability. Conversely, several plant physiological strategies have been identified along the mono-dimensional gradient of water availability in a given environment. According to a revised terminology, dehydration escape, dehydration avoidance, dehydration tolerance, dormancy, and desiccation tolerance are clearly distinguishable. Their sequential expression is expressed as water deficit increases while cavitation tolerance is proposed here to be a major hydraulic strategy underpinning adaptive responses to drought of vascular plants. This continuum of physiological strategies can be interpreted in the context of the ecological trade-off between water-acquisition vs. water-conservation, since growth maintenance is associated with fast water use under moderate drought while plant survival after growth cessation is associated with slow water use under severe drought. Consequently, the distinction between ‘drought resistance’ and ‘drought survival’, is emphasized as crucial to ensure a correct interpretation of plant strategies since ‘knowing when not to grow’ does not confer ‘drought resistance’ but may well enhance ‘drought survival’. This framework proposal should improve cross-fertilization between disciplines to help tackle the increasing worldwide challenges that drought poses to plant adaptation.},

We assessed PCS of alpine plant communities around the world, both within cushion plant foundation species and adjacent open ground, and compared the effects of foundation species and climate on alpha (within-microsite), beta (between open and cushion) and gamma (open and cushion combined) PCS. In the open, alpha PCS shifted from highly related to distantly related with increasing potential productivity. However, we found no relationship between gamma PCS and climate, due to divergence in phylogenetic composition between cushion and open sub-communities in severe environments, as demonstrated by increasing phylo-beta diversity. Thus, foundation species functioned as micro-refugia by facilitating less stress-tolerant lineages in severe environments, erasing a global productivity – phylogenetic diversity relationship that would go undetected without accounting for this important biotic interaction.},

Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems that display multiple alternative states and can shift from one to another in abrupt ways. Some of these tipping points have been identified and predicted by mathematical and computational models. Moreover, multiple scales are involved and potential mitigation or intervention scenarios are tied to particular levels of complexity, from cells to human–environment coupled systems. In dealing with a biosphere where humans are part of a complex, endangered ecological network, novel theoretical and engineering approaches need to be considered. At the centre of most research efforts is biodiversity, which is essential to maintain community resilience and ecosystem services. What can be done to mitigate, counterbalance or prevent tipping points? Using a 30-year window, we explore recent approaches to sense, preserve and restore ecosystem resilience as well as a number of proposed interventions (from afforestation to bioengineering) directed to mitigate or reverse ecosystem collapse. The year 2050 is taken as a representative future horizon that combines a time scale where deep ecological changes will occur and proposed solutions might be effective.

This is because co-occurrence among species is a measurable metric in community datasets that, in the context of phylogeny, geography, traits, and environment, can sometimes indicate the degree of competition, displacement, and phylogenetic repulsion as weighed against biotic and environmental eﬀects promoting correlated species distributions. Historically, a multitude of diﬀerent co-occurrence metrics have been developed and most have depended on data randomization procedures to produce null distributions for signiﬁcance testing.

He presented his model as a new procedure, a ‘pairwise approach’, different from analyses of whole presence–absence matrices to examine patterns of co-occurrence. Here I show that: (1) Veech’s method is identical to Fisher’s exact test, a standard procedure for measuring the statistical association between two discrete variables; (2) in a broad sense, the pairwise approach is very similar to early analyses of spatial association, such as the one advanced by Forbes in 1907; (3) implicit in Veech’s formula is a sampling scheme that is indistinguishable from wellknown matrix-level null models that randomize the distribution of species among equiprobable sites; (4) pairwise co-occurrence patterns can be analysed using any matrix-level null model, so pairwise comparisons are not limited to using Veech’s formula. The methodological distinction that Veech proposed between pairwise and matrix-level approaches does not in fact exist, although the conceptual distinction between the two approaches is still a debated topic.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic activities are increasingly affecting ecosystems across the globe. Meanwhile, empirical and theoretical evidence suggest that natural systems can exhibit abrupt collapses in response to incremental increases in the stressors, sometimes with dramatic ecological and economic consequences. These catastrophic shifts are faster and larger than expected from the changes in the stressors and happen once a tipping point is crossed. The primary mechanisms that drive ecosystem responses to perturbations lie in their architecture of relationships, i.e. how species interact with each other and with the physical environment and the spatial structure of the environment. Nonetheless, existing theoretical work on catastrophic shifts has so far largely focused on relatively simple systems that have either few species and/or no spatial structure. This work has laid a critical foundation for understanding how abrupt responses to incremental stressors are possible, but it remains difficult to predict (let alone manage) where or when they are most likely to occur in more complex real-world settings. Here, we discuss how scaling up our investigations of catastrophic shifts from simple to more complex—species rich and spatially structured—systems could contribute to expanding our understanding of how nature works and improve our ability to anticipate the effects of global change on ecological systems.

Examples include the synchronization of business cycles, population collapse in patchy ecosystems, markets shifting to a new technology platform, collapses in prices and in confidence in financial markets, and protests erupting in multiple countries. A number of mathematical models of these phenomena have multiple equilibria separated by saddle-node bifurcations. We study this behaviour in its normal form as fast–slow ordinary differential equations. In our model, a system consists of multiple subsystems, such as countries in the global economy or patches of an ecosystem. Each subsystem is described by a scalar quantity, such as economic output or population, that undergoes sudden changes via saddle-node bifurcations. The subsystems are coupled via their scalar quantity (e.g. trade couples economic output; diffusion couples populations); that coupling moves the locations of their bifurcations. The model demonstrates two ways in which sudden changes can propagate: they can cascade (one causing the next), or they can hop over subsystems. The latter is absent from classic models of cascades. For an application, we study the Arab Spring protests. After connecting the model to sociological theories that have bistability, we use socioeconomic data to estimate relative proximities to tipping points and Facebook data to estimate couplings among countries. We find that although protests tend to spread locally, they also seem to ‘hop' over countries, like in the stylized model; this result highlights a new class of temporal motifs in longitudinal network datasets.},

However, EWS are plagued by false negatives, leading to undetected catastrophes. One reason may be because EWS do not occur equally for all species in a system, so whether and how strongly EWS are detected depends on which species is being observed. Here, we illustrate how the strength of EWS is determined by each species’ relationship to properties of the noise, the system’s response to that noise, and the occurrence of critical slowing down (CSD, the dynamical phenomenon that gives rise to EWS). Using these relationships, we present general rules for maximizing EWS detection in ecological communities. We ﬁnd that for two-species competitive and mutualistic systems one should generally monitor the species experiencing smaller intraspeciﬁc effects to maximize EWS performance, while in consumer-resource systems one should monitor the species imposing the smaller interspeciﬁc effects. These guidelines appear to hold for at least some larger communities as well. We close by extending the theoretical basis for our rules to systems with any number of species and more complex forms of noise. Our ﬁndings provide important guidance on how to monitor systems for EWS to maximize detection of tipping points.},

We show that disturbances narrow the base of size-abundance pyramids, lower their height and decrease total community biomass in a nonlinear way.

However, we lack empirical evaluations of how the structure, strength and sign of these interactions drive the potential to coexist in diverse multi-trophic communities. Here we model community feasibility domains, a theoretically-informed measure of coexistence probability, from empirical data on communities comprising more than 50 species for three trophic guilds (plants, pollinators, and herbivores). Although feasibility domains vary depending on the number of trophic guilds considered, we show that higher network connectance leads to lower coexistence opportunities. Moreover, empirical estimations of the feasibility domains were higher with respect to random network structures but lower than a mean-field approach, suggesting that observed interaction structures tend to maximize coexistence within its imposed limits. Our results stress the importance of incorporating empirically-informed interaction structures within and across guilds to better understand how species coexist in diverse multi-trophic communities.},

Although much is explored on the mechanisms that affect tipping points and alternative stable states, little is known on how ecosystems with alternative stable states could have emerged in the first place. Here, we explore whether evolution by natural selection can lead to the emergence of ecosystems with tipping points using a toy model inspired by shallow lakes. Shallow lakes are the best-known example where a shift from a submersed macrophyte dominated state to a floating macrophyte dominated state in response to excess nutrient loading corresponds to a tipping point between alternative stable states. We model the evolution of the macrophyte's living depth in the lake, we identify the conditions under which the ancestor macrophyte population diversifies, and investigate whether alternate stable states dominated by different macrophyte phenotypes occur. Given the trade-off between access to light and nutrient along the water column, we show that asymmetry in competition for light is required for diversification, while alternative stable states require an additional mechanism, an unequal efficiency in nutrient removal. We find that eco-evolutionary dynamics may produce alternative stable states, but only under a restrictive range of conditions. Our analysis suggests that competitive asymmetries along opposing resource gradients may allow alternative stable states to emerge by natural selection.},

Plant recruitment in arid environments often occurs only in years with above average rainfall or in safe sites under the canopy of nurse plants that provide shelter from high temperatures and low moisture. Associations of establishing seedlings with adult plants are referred to as nurse-protégé interactions and are thought to be commensalisms in which seedlings benefit from the micro-environment created by adult plants with no effect for the latter. This phenomenon is thought to be more frequent in harsh than in mild environments and appears to occur frequently in deserts and arid and semi-arid biomes. Here, we investigate whether nurse-protégé interactions are more common in arid environments by searching the published literature from the previous 92 years using the terms nurse plants, protégé plants, facilitation, nucleation and facultative mutualism. We then quantitatively compared these reports from arid zones to other environments. A total of 296 papers were found which referred to nurse-protégé interactions. More than half (158) focused on arid and semi-arid zones. This information was also used to explore hypotheses of potential causative forces that might have selected for such interactions in the arid zones such as seed trapping, nutrient, moisture, protection from browsing or trampling and support availability. Because of the large number of different nurse species (147, from 98 genera and 40 families) and protégé species (429, from 273 genera and 84 families), described across a diversity of environments, we suggest that there may be more than one causative factor selecting for nurse-protégé interactions in arid and semi-arid environments.},

Similar results were recorded for Mediterranean shrub seedlings, which showed increased photoinhibition beneath adult shrub canopies, due to lower photosynthetic efficiency with the onset of drought
Under high stress condition, competitive shrubs could die and tolerant beneficiaries will be favored by the benefactor's legacy on soil conditions
Most dominant grasses in the steppe (tolerant species) tended to aggregate with the competitive shrubs, whereas the persistence and growth of the most competitive grass seemed to be enhanced below stress tolerant shrubs

In alpine systems, cushion plants commonly act as foundation species by ameliorating local conditions. Here, we analyze diversity patterns of species’ assembly within cushions and in adjacent surrounding open substrates (83 sites across ﬁve continents) calculating ﬂoristic dissimilarity between replicate plots, and using linear models to analyze relationships between microhabitats and species diversity. Floristic dissimilarity did not change across biogeographic regions, but was consistently lower in the cushions than in the open microhabitat. Cushion plants appear to enable recruitment of many relatively stress-intolerant species that otherwise would not establish in these communities, yet the niche space constructed by cushion plants supports a more homogeneous composition of species than the niche space beyond the cushion’s inﬂuence. As a result, cushion plants support higher adiversity and a larger species pool, but harbor assemblies with lower b-diversity than open microhabitats. We conclude that habitats with and without dominant foundation species can strongly differ in the processes that drive species recruitment, and thus the relationship between local and regional species diversity.},

Although there is a good understanding of the probabilities of seedling establishment of Bromus pictus in relation to location within these patches, these probabilities account for only a portion of the spatial dynamics of the community. The objective of this paper was to assess the pattern and dynamics of Bromus pictus seed availability in this community, which represent the other portion of the recruitment equation. We ﬁrst evaluated its seed bank along transects. Plant- or litter-covered areas had 85\% of the sampled seeds; however, they accounted for 55\% of the area. Bare-soil areas had seeds only if they were located close (Յ10 cm) to a plant or litter microsite. In a second study, we analyzed the movement of seeds using pitfall traps. Traps located near plants captured seed amounts similar to those from traps located in bare-ground areas (far from plants). The contrast between the high number of seeds in transit and the low number of seeds retained by bareground microsites illustrates the importance of lateral secondary movement of seeds. We used this information on seed distribution and previous data about establishment probabilities to estimate the spatial pattern of recruitment. Microsites that are vegetated or close to individual plants are expected to recruit the greatest number of individuals. Vegetation patches play an important role in modifying ecological processes in arid and semiarid communities. Our results highlight the importance of seed distribution in the formation and maintenance of these patches.},

However, the theory appears complicated and hard to connect to real systems. We synthesize results from three different kinds of models: interacting particle systems, moment equations for spatial point processes, and metapopulation or patch models. Studies using all three frameworks agree that spatial dynamics need not enhance coexistence nor slow down dynamics; their effects depend on the underlying competitive interactions in the community. When similar species would coexist in a nonspatial habitat, endogenous spatial structure inhibits coexistence and slows dynamics. When a dominant species disperses poorly and the weaker species has higher fecundity or better dispersal, competition-colonization trade-offs enhance coexistence. Even when species have equal dispersal and per-generation fecundity, spatial successional niches where the weaker and faster-growing species can rapidly exploit ephemeral local resources can enhance coexistence.

Results: Seedling emergence is more sensitive to climate conditions than later stages of growth. When considering the whole set of species, the total number of established seedlings at the end of the experiment was lower in the drought and warming stands than in control ones, and vegetation canopy increased the number of these seedlings in the drought stands. Drought reduced seedling emergence but not warming, while the interaction between climate treatments and vegetation canopy was not significant. Seedling survival was lower in the warming treatment than in the control. Under drought conditions, vegetation canopy increased seedling emergence of the dominant Globularia alypum. In control stands, vegetation canopy reduced their survival. Vegetation canopy increased the survival of the dominant Erica multiflora in warming stands, and it reduced the survival of G. alypum in drought stands. No significant effects of drought and warming were observed in the seed rain of these two species.
Conclusions: The balance of the facilitation-competition interactions between vegetation canopy and seedling establishment in Mediterranean-type ecosystems determined by water availability, and drought conditions enhance the positive effect of vegetation canopy. This interaction is species-specific and shows important between-year variability.},

	abstract = {Ecological processes of low-productivity ecosystems have long been considered to be driven by abiotic controls with biotic interactions playing an insigniﬁcant role. However, existing studies present conﬂicting evidence concerning the roles of these factors, in part due to the short temporal extent of most data sets and inability to test indirect effects of environmental variables modulated by biotic interactions. Using structural equation modeling to analyze 65 years of perennial vegetation change in the Sonoran Desert, we found that precipitation had a stronger positive effect on recruitment beneath existing canopies than in open microsites due to reduced evaporation rates. Variation in perennial canopy cover had additional facilitative effects on juvenile recruitment, which was indirectly driven by effects of density and precipitation on cover. Mortality was strongly inﬂuenced by competition as indicated by negative density-dependence, whereas precipitation had no effect. The combined direct, indirect, and interactive facilitative effects of precipitation and cover on recruitment were substantial, as was the effect of competition on mortality, providing strong evidence for dual control of community dynamics by climate and biotic interactions. Through an empirically derived simulation model, we also found that the positive feedback of density on cover produces unique temporal abundance patterns, buffering changes in abundance from high frequency variation in precipitation, amplifying effects of low frequency variation, and decoupling community abundance from precipitation patterns at high abundance. Such dynamics should be generally applicable to low-productivity systems in which facilitation is important and can only be understood within the context of long-term variation in climatic patterns. This predictive model can be applied to better manage low-productivity ecosystems, in which variation in biogeochemical processes and trophic dynamics may be driven by positive density-dependent feedbacks that inﬂuence temporal abundance and productivity patterns.},

	abstract = {Water is the key determinant factor of ecosystem balance, especially in hot desert regions facing multiple climatic and edaphic constraints. In the Sahara Desert, vegetation associated to man-made mesic environments such as open-air irrigation channels and oases is little studied. In order to understand the vegetation–water relationship in xeric environments, the present study focused on estimating diversity and determining functional traits of plant communities established around water points developed near water towers in the region of Adrar (Sahara Desert of Algeria). Based on data collected from 31 phytoecological relevés, spontaneous vegetation was analyzed using diversity parameters (viz. species richness, diversity, richness estimation and similarity), and plant functional traits ‘PFT’ (viz. life forms, morphological, phytogeographical and dispersal types, Grime’s and Noy-Meir’s strategies). A total of 4695 individuals belonging to 53 plant species and 23 families were collected. Rarefaction and extrapolation curves applied for all the surveys carried out indicated that the estimated species richness is projected to be 77.2 ± 10 species from 31 survey plots and it is predicted to reach up to 116 ± 30 species from 200 survey plots, which represents an increase of 119\% of the observed species richness. According to the real spectrum (abundance-based data) of PFT, plant species are mainly hemicryptophytes (54.12\%) and arid-actives (69.97\%) that adopt various dispersal strategies including anemochores (57.68\%) and barochores (36.68\%). Grime’s strategies showed the predominance of competitive and stress-tolerant species (52.76\%). The phytogeographical analysis revealed the dominance in the strict sense of the Tropical-Mediterranean-SaharoArabian element (36.59\%) which adapts well to the Saharan climate. This study showed the role of water in shaping the functional characteristics of vegetation in hyper-arid regions. The functional diversity of Saharan vegetation reflects species strategies for a better exploitation of the water and guaranteeing their coexistence in hyper-arid environments.},

	abstract = {Projected global change will increase the level of land-use and environmental stressors such as drought and grazing, particularly in drylands. Still, combined effects of drought and grazing on plant production are poorly understood, thus hampering adequate projections and development of mitigation strategies. We used a large, cross-continental database consisting of 174 long-term datasets from {\textgreater}30 dryland regions to quantify ecosystem responses to drought and grazing with the ultimate goal to increase functional understanding in these responses. Two key aspects of ecosystem stability, resistance to and recovery after a drought, were evaluated based on standardized and normalized aboveground net primary production (ANPP) data. Drought intensity was quantiﬁed using the standardized precipitation index. We tested effects of drought intensity, grazing regime (grazed, ungrazed), biome (grassland, shrubland, savanna) or dominant life history (annual, perennial) of the herbaceous layer to assess the relative importance of these factors for ecosystem stability, and to identify predictable relationships between drought intensity and ecosystem resistance and recovery. We found that both components of ecosystem stability were better explained by dominant herbaceous life history than by biome. Increasing drought intensity (quasi-) linearly reduced ecosystem resistance. Even though annual and perennial systems showed the same response rate to increasing drought intensity, they differed in their general magnitude of resistance, with annual systems being ca. 27\% less resistant. In contrast, systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals had substantially higher postdrought recovery, particularly when grazed. Combined effects of drought and grazing were not merely additive but modulated by dominant life history of the herbaceous layer. To the best of our knowledge, our study established the ﬁrst predictive, cross-continental model between drought intensity and drought-related relative losses in ANPP, and suggests that systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals are more prone to ecosystem degradation under future global change regimes.},

These specializations are ubiquitous in plant communities, but all three have never been derived from a spatial model of community dynamics—instead, the possibility of rapid exploitation has been either overlooked or confounded with colonization. We use moment equations, equations for the mean densities and spatial covariance of competing plant populations, to characterize these strategies in a fully spatial stochastic model. The moment equations predict endogenous spatial pattern formation and the efﬁcacy of spatial strategies under different conditions. The model shows that specializations for colonization, exploitation, and tolerance are all possible, and these are the only possible spatial strategies; among them, they partition all of the endogenous spatial structure in the environment. The model predicts two distinct short-dispersal specializations where parents disperse their offspring locally, either to exploit empty patches quickly or to ﬁll patches to exclude competitors.},

For three target species, four key functional traits were estimated for seedlings grown in greenhouse conditions (total dry biomass, plant water content, root:shoot ratio, and apical growth rate). Our results showed that facilitation strength can be explained by the interaction between nurse and target traits. Facilitation increased when low SLA nurses interacted with targets investing in apical growth, thus acquisitive targets are benefited by the greater availability of resources left by conservative nurses. Facilitation also increased when nurses with lower values of leaf ∂C13 interacted with high root:shoot ratio targets, so early release of light and soil resources due to nurse earlier leaf loss benefits drought resistant targets. Besides, root volume of the nurse promoted facilitation, probably due to improvements on soil conditions. Functional trait match can shed light on plant community assembly rules and help promote ecosystem restoration and management.},

The presence of neighboring trees (nurses) can increase the establishment of seedlings (targets) by improving resource availability and microclimate. The nurse effect, however, might vary depending on nurse-­target species combinations but factors that predict this specificity are poorly known. We used a multispecies experiment to investigate the facilitation potential of trees from a range of successional stages, focusing on how nurse functional traits can predict species-­ specific interaction outcomes. We conducted a factorial field experiment in a Brazilian semiarid tropical forest during a severe drought period. Sixty pairs of interacting tree species, 20 potential nurses, and three targets were used. Seedlings of all targets were planted both under and far from the nurse canopy, in a randomized block design replicated five times. Target growth and survival were monitored for 275 days from the beginning of the dry season, and interaction outcomes were calculated using the Relative Interaction Intensity (RII) index. Nurse functional traits such as successional stage, height, wood density, and canopy diameter were used as explanatory variables to predict RII values. The average effect of nurse species on target plants was in general positive, that is, seedling survival and growth increased under the nurse canopy. However, for growth pairwise interactions were significantly species specific. Successional stage was the only functional trait explaining RII values, with pioneer tree species being stronger facilitators than later successional trees. However, the explanation power of this variable was low, and positive, negative, or neutral interactions were found among nurse trees of all successional stages. Because seedling mortality during drought in semiarid systems is high, future studies should investigate how nurse traits related to water use could influence nurse facilitation skills.},

	abstract = {Plant functioning and survival in drylands are aﬀected by the combination of high solar radiation, high temperatures, low relative humidity, and the scarcity of available water. Many ecophysiological studies have dealt with the adaptation of plants to cope with these stresses in hot deserts, which are the territories that have better evoked the idea of a dryland. Nevertheless, drylands can also be found in some other areas of the Earth that are under the Mediterranean-type climates, which imposes a strong aridity during summer. In this review, plant species from hot deserts and Mediterranean-type climates serve as examples for describing and analyzing the diﬀerent responses of trees and shrubs to aridity in drylands, with special emphasis on the structural and functional adaptations of plants to avoid the negative eﬀects of high temperatures under drought conditions. First, we analyze the adaptations of plants to reduce the input of energy by diminishing the absorbed solar radiation through (i) modiﬁcations of leaf angle and (ii) changes in leaf optical properties. Afterwards, we analyze several strategies that enhance the ability for heat dissipation through (i) leaf size reduction and changes in leaf shape (e.g., through lobed leaves), and (ii) increased transpiration rates (i.e., water-spender strategy), with negative consequences in terms of photosynthetic capacity and water consumption, respectively. Finally, we also discuss the alternative strategy showed by water-saver plants, a common drought resistance strategy in hot and dry environments that reduces water consumption at the expense of diminishing the ability for leaf cooling. In conclusion, trees and shrubs living in drylands have developed eﬀective functional adaptations to cope with the combination of high temperature and water scarcity, all of them with clear beneﬁts for plant functioning and survival, but also with diﬀerent costs concerning water use, carbon gain, and/or leaf cooling.},

	abstract = {Increases in drought frequency in combination with overgrazing may result in degradation of (semi-) arid ecosystems. Facilitative interactions between plants are a key mechanism in preventing degradation, but it is poorly understood how they respond to increased stress by combined drought and herbivory. In this study, we used an ecohydrological model, to simulate the plant growth of two plant species interacting with each other under different rainfall and herbivory pressure scenarios. The functional traits of the two modeled plants were based on a prior ﬁeld experiment in southeastern Spain, in which an unpalatable “nurse” species protected a palatable prote´ge´ species from herbivory. Moreover, the nurse species was more drought-resistant; that is, it had a lower wilting point, whereas the prote´ge´ species had a higher optimal growth rate. Firstly, we investigated the coexistence of the two plant species growing under a single limiting resource, focusing on the effect of intra-seasonal rainfall variability. We found that longer periods without rainfall within the wet season resulted in stable coexistence, whereas nearly constant rainfall led to competitive exclusion of the prote´ge´ by the nurse species. Secondly, we investigated how plant interactions varied along our studied gradients. Using the neighbor effect intensity and importance indices, we found that competitive effects increased with more constant rainfall. Moreover, higher herbivory rates resulted in increased facilitative effects of the nurse on the prote´ge´ species, but facilitative effects could only prevail over competitive effects under currently observed or higher intra-seasonal rainfall variability. This study highlights the relevance of intra-seasonal rainfall variability in explaining coexistence of species in dryland ecosystems and shows that increasing intra-seasonal rainfall variability or herbivory pressure can result in more facilitative effects from a nurse species. This information is crucial to obtain a better insight into the long-term coexistence of species, and the resulting stability of dryland ecosystems in response to future climate change.},

              Facilitation studies typically compare plants under differential stress levels with and without neighbors, while the density of neighbors has rarely been addressed. However, recent empirical studies indicate that facilitation may be density-dependent too and peak at intermediate neighbor densities. Here, we propose a conceptual model to incorporate density-dependence into theory about changes of plant–plant interactions under stress. To test our predictions, we combine an individual-based model incorporating both facilitative response and effect, with an experiment using salt stress and
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              . Theoretical and experimental results are strikingly consistent: (1) the intensity of facilitation peaks at intermediate density, and this peak shifts to higher densities with increasing stress; (2) this shift further modifies the balance between facilitation and competition such that the stress-gradient hypothesis applies only at high densities. Our model suggests that density-dependence must be considered for predicting plant–plant interactions under environmental change.},

	abstract = {Vegetation spatial patterns emerge in response to feedback interactions between organisms and their environment, because of the redistribution of water and nutrients around the plant canopy or as a consequence of facilitation/competition interactions at the plant level, even in the absence of pre-existing substratum heterogeneities. It has been suggested that changes in vegetation spatial patterns are a signal of transition shift in ecosystems. Understanding the factors that lead to aggregated spatial patterns and control the transition to random distributions requires that environmental and species information is taken into account. In this study, we investigated the relative contributions of aridity (a long-term process), to which vegetation is adapted, and the area covered by bare soil (short-term process) to plant–plant associations and their contribution to aggregated spatial patterns. The study was conducted in a gradient of aridity ranging from that in subalpine grassland habitats in the Pyrenees and Sierra Nevada mountains to that in the semiarid steppes of Cabo de Gata and the middle Ebro Valley in Spain. We compared sites that differed in aridity and a geophysical feature (north- vs. south-facing slope). We observed that the relative contribution of aridity and bare soil to plant–plant facilitation and vegetation aggregation differed in subalpine and semiarid areas. Facilitation in subalpine habitats had a marked effect on aggregated spatial patterns, while aridity contributed to disruption of these patterns. Conversely, in semiarid habitats, the disruption of aggregated patterns was mainly promoted by an increase in bare soil area rather than in aridity. In semiarid habitats, the higher level of stress on south-facing slopes increased facilitation interactions relative to north-facing slopes, although this did not enhance the persistence of aggregated spatial patterns. We conclude that the use of aggregated spatial patterns as an indicator of ecosystem shift must distinguish and separately take account of long-term processes to which vegetation adapt, and short-term process.},

We developed the network analysis of traits (NAT) to show changes in community network structure based on the changes in the composition and connectivity between clusters of species that share traits that imply shifts in functional diversity. We tested the application of NAT on a 113 species found on an intertidal sandflat that was subject to experimental nitrogen addition (control [0 g N/m2], medium [150 g N/m2], and high [600 g N/m2]). This allowed us to directly link mechanistic changes in community composition and function with the trait-space network patterns revealed by NAT. We demonstrate that under medium (150 g N/m2) N treatment, functional diversity remained consistent, whereas increasing disturbance to high (600 g N/m2) N treatment affected the species–trait network structure and caused merging of functional clusters implying a loss of functional trait diversity.},

However, the ecological networks approach is being integrated very slowly in plant community ecology, even though the first studies on plant facilitation networks (FNs) were published more than a decade ago. The study of interaction networks between established plants and plants recruiting beneath them, which we call Recruitment Networks (RNs), can provide new insights on mechanisms driving plant community structure and dynamics. RNs basically describe which plants recruit under which others, so they can be seen as a generalisation of the classic FNs since they do not imply any particular effect (positive, negative or neutral) of the established plants on recruiting ones. RNs summarise information on the structure of sapling banks. More importantly, the information included in RNs can be incorporated into models of replacement dynamics to evaluate how different aspects of network structure, or different mechanisms of network assembly, may affect plant community stability and species coexistence. To allow an efficient development of the study of FNs and RNs, here we unify concepts, synthesise current knowledge, clarify some conceptual issues, and propose basic methodological guidelines to standardise sampling methods that could make future studies of these networks directly comparable.},

	abstract = {Herbivory by domestic and wild ungulates is a major driver of global vegetation dynamics. However, grazing is not considered in dynamic global vegetation models, or more generally in studies of the effects of environmental change on ecosystems at regional to global scale. An obstacle to this is a lack of empirical tests of several hypotheses linking plant traits with grazing. We, therefore, set out to test whether some widely recognized trait responses to grazing are consistent at the global level. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant trait responses to grazing, based on 197 studies from all major regions of the world, and using six major conceptual models of trait response to grazing as a framework. Data were available for seven plant traits: life history, canopy height, habit, architecture, growth form (forb, graminoid, herbaceous legume, woody), palatability, and geographic origin. Covariates were precipitation and evolutionary history of herbivory. Overall, grazing favoured annual over perennial plants, short plants over tall plants, prostrate over erect plants, and stoloniferous and rosette architecture over tussock architecture. There was no consistent effect of grazing on growth form. Some response patterns were modiﬁed by particular combinations of precipitation and history of herbivory. Climatic and historical contexts are therefore essential for understanding plant trait responses to grazing. Our study identiﬁes some key traits to be incorporated into plant functional classiﬁcations for the explicit consideration of grazing into global vegetation models used in global change research. Importantly, our results suggest that plant functional type classiﬁcations and response rules need to be speciﬁc to regions with different climate and herbivory history.},

	abstract = {Methods: We estimated the effect of shrubs using a log response ratio based on annual species population sizes underneath shrub canopies and in open spaces. We collected density data of annual species in 18 visits between Aug 2010 and Apr 2013 in permanent 50-cm square areas laid out according to a split-plot design, in which the activity of livestock (fenced and unfenced; plots were 10-m squares) was the main factor, and microsite type (shrub and open) was the subordinate factor, with 20 replicates for each combination. We also gathered data on eight functional traits (characterizing whole plants, leaves, roots and seeds) from annual plants collected in the study site following standardized protocols.
Results: Annual species with acquisitive attributes (high speciﬁc leaf area, intermediate-to-low leaf dry matter content, large leaves and high speciﬁc root volume) were more beneﬁted by shrubs compared to species with the opposite, relatively conservative attributes. Facilitative inﬂuences of shrubs were pervasive during winter, while competitive inﬂuences increased in frequency during summer, when total plant density was higher. This pattern was not affected by livestock.
Conclusions: The outcome of species interactions depended on the interplay between plant strategies and abiotic stress: facilitated species were mostly acquisitive, and shrub facilitation was more important during the harshest season (winter). Speciﬁc root volume, along with widely used functional traits (speciﬁc leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf size) delineated such strategies. This underlines the importance of considering below-ground traits when studying plant–plant interactions. Single traits achieved superior explanatory power of shrub effects than composite ones (i.e. principal component axes based on single traits), reinforcing the idea that single functional traits are themselves meaningful indicators of complex physiological trade-offs that ultimately affect community structure and dynamics.},

Show how some characteristic (growth curves) are similar across biota but also population \& communities (which emerge independently from individual-level scaling, cf Hatton et al 2015).
Discuss how this power law regulates prey-predator \& competitive interactions and how it often leads to stability of the system. With this metabolic scaling, it overcomes the paradox of plankton \& paradox of enrichment as stability \& coexistence are mediated through this growth regulation

First, this wall is an obstacle to the study of most microorganisms, which constitute a large part of the Earth’s biodiversity. Asexual reproduction, gene transfer and the lack of a clear deﬁnition of the species taxonomic level blur the distinction between ecological changes in species abundances and evolutionary changes in genotype frequencies in microbes. Second, a key question that biodiversity science will have to address in the coming decades is how ecological systems will cope with rapid environmental change. Generalising the concept of adaptation across multiple timescales and levels of organisation would provide an integrative framework for studying the combined ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental change, and thus help us to address one the major scientiﬁc challenges of our time.},

Complex adaptive system is not incompatible with ecosystem level selection

Example with plant-herbivore interaction
Two interactions : direct antagonism through grazing and indirect mutualism through nutrient cycling.

Spatial model with two types of plants (palatable \& non-palatable) and herbivores that can feed on different patches.
There is a conflict between patch selection and meta-patch selection. 
At the patch level, selection favour resistance of plants while between patch selection favour tolerant one as they have a higher fitness and may colonize more empty patches relatively to other patches.


Tolerance evolve if spatial aggregation is strong enough or patch size is small enough. See the associated paper.

As viewed here, ecological succession involves the development of ecosystems; it has many parallels in the developmental biology of organisms, and also in the development of human society.



It culminates in a stabilized ecosystem in which maximum biomass (or high information content) and symbiotic function between organisms are maintained per unit of available energy flow.

We used remote sensing, modeling, and field data to test the hypothesis that the long-distance impact of an invasive species dramatically affects one of the largest tidal flat ecosystems in East Asia. We found that the invasion of exotic cordgrass

	abstract = {Abstract 1. Rapid technological advancements and increasing data availability have improved the capacity to monitor and evaluate Earth?s ecology via remote sensing. However, remote sensing is notoriously ?blind? to fine-scale ecological processes such as interactions among plants, which encompass a central topic in ecology. 2. Here, we discuss how remote sensing technologies can help infer plant-plant interactions and their roles in shaping plant-based systems at individual, community, and landscape levels. At each of these levels, we outline the key attributes of ecosystems that emerge as a product of plant-plant interactions and could possibly be detected by remote sensing data. We review the theoretical bases, approaches, and prospects of how inference of plant-plant interactions can be assessed remotely. 3. At the individual level, we illustrate how close-range remote sensing tools can help to infer plant-plant interactions, especially in experimental settings. At the community level, we use forests to illustrate how remotely-sensed community structure can be used to infer dominant interactions as a fundamental force in shaping plant communities. At the landscape level, we highlight how remotely-sensed attributes of vegetation states and spatial vegetation patterns can be used to assess the role of local plant-plant interactions in shaping landscape ecological systems. 4. Synthesis. Remote sensing extends the domain of plant ecology to broader and finer spatial scales, assisting to scale ecological patterns and search for generic rules. Robust remote sensing approaches are likely to extend our understanding of how plant-plant interactions shape ecological processes across scales ? from individuals to landscapes. Combining these approaches with theories, models, experiments, data-driven approaches, and data analysis algorithms will firmly embed remote sensing techniques into ecological context and open new pathways to better understand biotic interactions.},

	abstract = {Conspecific negative density dependence is ubiquitous and has long been recognized as an important factor favoring the coexistence of competing species at local scale. By contrast, a positive density-dependent growth rate is thought to favor species exclusion by inhibiting the growth of less competitive species. Yet, such conspecific positive density dependence often reduces extrinsic mortality (e.g. reduced predation), which favors species exclusion in the first place. Here, using a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, I show that this form of positive density dependence can favor the existence of equilibrium points characterized by species coexistence. Those equilibria are not globally stable, but allow the maintenance of species-rich communities in multispecies simulations. Therefore, conspecific positive density dependence does not necessarily favor species exclusion. On the contrary, some forms of conspecific positive density dependence may even help maintain species richness in natural communities. These results should stimulate further investigations into the precise mechanisms underlying density dependence.},

The idea of this chapter is to understand the dynamics and mechanisms leading to the patterns observed in ecosystems.
Space has 2 consequences : heterogeneity between habitats and regional influence of habitats on a focal one -{\textgreater} many potential feedbacks.
Diamond observation of patchiness of bird occurence : advanced competitive exclusion to explain the patterns (checkerboard pattern explained by competitive exclusion). but later contested by Simberloff
Two approaches for modelling these systems : fraction of patches (erase patch variability in island size, distance) or each patch having its own dynamics (more equations, more complex): describe first models. e.g. a single-species, N-patch model is formally analogous to an N-species mutualistic system
(10.10 p174) Goes to multi-species/multi-patch models with competition \& mutualism : e.g. two species in two forest patches. Competition local but intraspecific mutualism within patch. Analytical results
Goes in the question rooted in metapopulation theory : design of protected areas : many small or one big ? -{\textgreater} may depend on patch characteristics, dispersal, species characteristics also.

	annote = {11. Spatially Heterogeneous Ecosystems: Pattern Formation
Start with the formation of river meander (méandres) and human societies/villages
Diffusion models : pattern formation through diffusion instability (p192!!) : demonstrate that it is not possible in mutualistic or competitive systems but rather in prey-predator ones.
Emergence of patterns occur through a initially uniform spatial environment that is disrubed. The perturbation is further reinforced by positive feedbacks
Spatial diffusion is a negative feedback but can trigger instabilities in prey-predator systems but not in mutualistic/competitive systems
Example is taken from two competing plant species.

	annote = {13. The ecosystem and succession
First chapter to scale up to ecosystems and examine ecological sucession.
Ecosystems seen as self-organizing, non-equilibrated, open, entities.
Positive feedbacks as key in the succession of species but with negative feedbacks being dominant in the “late stage of succession, near climax”.
Clements (cf papers in other folder) : sees the mutual reinforcement occuring in succession : "habitat and population act and react upon each other, alternating as cause and effect until a state of equilibrium is reached” (with the concept, at the time, that equilibrium existed in ecosystems)
e.g. of feedback loops:  nutrient recycling (+), biomass growth (+), primary production in relation to nutrients (-)
Deterministic model of succession in a Clements way of thinking (1 or 2 species with their environment) versus stochastic markov model.
Example of kelp-urchin-lobster positive feedbacks (see Ling 2010 PNAS).
Perspective on the superorganism term for ecosystems. For instance, for Odum and Biever, ecosystem is a network of “autotroph-heterotroph mutualisms that involve highly specialized, coevolved species”. REview Wilson \& Williams arguments against superorganism view.
Wilson model : consider a earthworm P modifying the soil, thus facilitating other earthworms, and, another earthworm Q is cheating withtout producing enzymes to modify the soil. depending on the hypothesis this model favour the argument of loose assemblage of species or organism.
In this debate the key question is what is the degree of integration or coherence of an ecosystem. The reality may lie between both extremes. On one hand, species interacts and are not just random loose collection of species. On the other hand, communities are not so integrated that they form a superorganism.
Possible integration of ecosystems with competition between feedback loops in different spatial patches.
Great historical perspective on successions with associated feedbacks and models !!

	abstract = {The transport of resource subsidies by animals has been documented across a range of species and ecosystems. Although many of these studies have shown that animal resource subsidies can have signiﬁcant effects on nutrient cycling, ecosystem productivity, and food-web structure, there is a great deal of variability in the occurrence and strength of these effects. Here we propose a conceptual framework for understanding the context dependency of animal resource subsidies, and for developing and testing predictions about the effects of animal subsidies over space and time. We propose a general framework, in which abiotic characteristics and animal vector characteristics from the donor ecosystem interact to determine the quantity, quality, timing, and duration (QQTD) of an animal input. The animal input is translated through the lens of recipient ecosystem characteristics, which include both abiotic and consumer characteristics, to yield the QQTD of the subsidy. The translated subsidy inﬂuences recipient ecosystem dynamics through effects on both trophic structure and ecosystem function, which may both inﬂuence the recipient ecosystem’s response to further inputs and feed back to inﬂuence the donor ecosystem. We present a review of research on animal resource subsidies across ecosystem boundaries, placed within the context of this framework, and we discuss how the QQTD of resource subsidies can inﬂuence trophic structure and ecosystem function in recipient ecosystems. We explore the importance of understanding context dependency of animal resource subsidies in increasingly altered ecosystems, in which the characteristics of both animal vectors and donor and recipient ecosystems may be changing rapidly. Finally, we make recommendations for future research on animal resource subsidies, and resource subsidies in general, that will increase our understanding and predictive capacity about their ecosystem effects.},

This view, however, is incomplete because it does not acknowledge that predators may play a signiﬁcant role in the delivery of critical life-support services such as ecosystem nutrient cycling. New research is beginning to show that predator effects on nutrient cycling are ubiquitous. These effects emerge from direct nutrient excretion, egestion or translocation within and across ecosystem boundaries after prey consumption, and from indirect effects mediated by predator interactions with prey. Depending on their behavioural ecology, predators can create heterogeneous or homogeneous nutrient distributions across natural landscapes. Because predator species are disproportionately vulnerable to elimination from ecosystems, we stand to lose much more from their disappearance than their simple charismatic attractiveness.},

Results Herbivores deposited substantial amounts of nitrogen in serpentine grasslands via their feces, while carnivore scat was a high-quality but less predictable resource subsidy. Neither trophic group’s fecal deposition reinforced or diluted productivity gradients in the landscape. Rather, unproductive fragments received minimal nutrients, while more productive fragments had the chance of receiving higher resource inputs. Feces from both types of consumers contained viable seeds, but herbivores and carnivores transported non-overlapping subsets of plant species.
Conclusions Consumers play different roles connecting plant communities in the landscape according to trophic level. Small herbivores are a continuous source of nutrient cycling, and their feces contains serpentine-adapted plant species, potentially serving as vectors for stepping-stone dispersal. While carnivores may be important vectors for long-distance seed dispersal, their movement patterns also make them more likely to deposit seeds in unsuitable environments.},

              A direct connection exists between aboveground communities and belowground soil microbiota: Soil microbes break down detrital inputs from above. Generally, it has been assumed that this relationship is largely driven by the soil community and the quality of the unconsumed plant-matter that makes up the majority of detritus in most ecosystems.

When these grasshopper carcasses were subsequently integrated into the plant litter, they significantly slowed the decomposition rate, although there was no impact on the rate of decomposition of the grasshoppers themselves. Thus, the mere presence of predators, and the stress they impose, can have cascading trophic impacts and even influence the process of decomposition.

            The risk of being eaten by spiders changes the elemental composition of grasshoppers, which affects soil microbes.
          , 
            Aboveground consumers are believed to affect ecosystem functioning by regulating the quantity and quality of plant litter entering the soil. We uncovered a pathway whereby terrestrial predators regulate ecosystem processes via indirect control over soil community function. Grasshopper herbivores stressed by spider predators have a higher body carbon-to-nitrogen ratio than do grasshoppers raised without spiders. This change in elemental content does not slow grasshopper decomposition but perturbs belowground community function, decelerating the subsequent decomposition of plant litter. This legacy effect of predation on soil community function appears to be regulated by the amount of herbivore protein entering the soil.},

The general view is that the rate and efficiency of nutrient transfer up the food chain is constrained by herbivore-specific capacity to secure N-rich compounds for survival and production. Using feeding trials with artificial food, we show, however, that physiological stress-response of grasshopper herbivores to spider predation risk alters the nature of the nutrient constraint. Grasshoppers facing predation risk had higher metabolic rates than control grasshoppers. Elevated metabolism accordingly increased requirements for dietary digestible carbohydrate-C to fuel-heightened energy demands. Moreover, digestible carbohydrate-C comprises a small fraction of total plant tissue-C content, so nutrient transfer between plants and herbivores accordingly becomes more constrained by digestible plant C than by total plant C:N. This shift in herbivore diet to meet the altered nutrient requirement increased herbivore body C:N content, the C:N content of the plant community from which grasshoppers select their diet, and grasshopper fecal C:N content. Chronic predation risk thus alters the quality of animal and plant tissue that eventually enters the detrital pool to become decomposed. Our results demonstrate that herbivore physiology causes C:N requirements and nutrient intake to become flexible, thereby providing a mechanism to explain context dependence in the nature of trophic control over nutrient transfer in ecosystems.},

By manipulating the presence of herbivores and predators, we show that even without an initial change in total plant or herbivore biomass, the cascading effects of predators in this system begin to affect carbon cycling through enhanced carbon fixation by plants. Prolonged cascading effects on plant biomass lead to slowing of carbon loss via ecosystem respiration and reallocation of carbon among plant aboveground and belowground tissues. Consequently, up to 1.4-fold more carbon is retained in plant biomass when carnivores are present compared with when they are absent, owing primarily to greater carbon storage in grass and belowground plant biomass driven largely by predator nonconsumptive (fear) effects on herbivores. Our data highlight the influence that the mere presence of predators, as opposed to direct consumption of herbivores, can have on carbon uptake, allocation, and retention in terrestrial ecosystems.},

              Populations of the world’s largest carnivores are declining and now occupy mere fractions of their historical ranges. Theory predicts that when apex predators disappear, large herbivores become less fearful, occupy new habitats, and modify those habitats by eating new food plants. Yet experimental support for this prediction has been difficult to obtain in large-mammal systems. After the extirpation of leopards and African wild dogs from Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park, forest-dwelling antelopes [bushbuck (
              Tragelaphus sylvaticus

While previous theoretical and empirical studies demonstrate the influence of allochthonous subsidies on bottom-up and topdown processes, understanding how these forces act in conjunction is still limited, particularly when an allochthonous resource can simultaneously subsidize multiple trophic levels. Using the Lake My´vatn region in Iceland as an example system of allochthony and its potential effects on multiple trophic levels, we analyzed a mathematical model to evaluate how pulsed subsidies of aquatic insects affect the dynamics of a soil–plant–arthropod food web. We found that the relative balance of top-down and bottom-up effects on a given food web compartment was determined by trophic position, subsidy magnitude, and top predators’ ability to exploit the subsidy. For intermediate trophic levels (e.g., detritivores and herbivores), we found that the subsidy could either alleviate or intensify top-down pressure from the predator. For some parameter combinations, alleviation and intensification occurred sequentially during and after the resource pulse. The total effect of the subsidy on detritivores and herbivores, including topdown and bottom-up processes, was determined by the rate at which predator consumption saturated with increasing size of the allochthonous subsidy, with greater saturation leading to increased bottom-up effects. Our findings illustrate how resource pulses to multiple trophic levels can influence food web dynamics by changing the relative strength of bottom-up and top-down effects, with bottom-up predominating top-down effects in most scenarios in this subarctic system.},

            The ratio of predator-to-prey biomass is a key element of trophic structure that is typically investigated from a food chain perspective, ignoring channels of energy transfer (e.g. omnivory) that may govern community structure. Here, we address this shortcoming by characterising the biomass structure of 141 freshwater, marine and terrestrial food webs, spanning a broad gradient in community biomass. We test whether sub-linear scaling between predator and prey biomass (a potential signal of density-dependent processes) emerges within ecosystem types and across levels of biological organisation. We find a consistent, sub-linear scaling pattern whereby predator biomass scales with the total biomass of their prey with a near ¾-power exponent within food webs - i.e. more prey biomass supports proportionally less predator biomass. Across food webs, a similar sub-linear scaling pattern emerges between total predator biomass and the combined biomass of all prey within a food web. These general patterns in trophic structure are compatible with a systematic form of density dependence that holds among complex feeding interactions across levels of organization, irrespective of ecosystem type.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Herbivores influence nutrient cycling by depositing feces across the landscape. Where herbivores go in the landscape is governed by factors such as food requirements and vulnerability to predation, traits that are related to body size. We show that mammals that differ in body size not only use the landscape differently but also differ in the amount of nitrogen relative to phosphorus that they release through their feces. This ensures that plants that grow in areas used by predominantly larger herbivores (such as areas of higher predation risk or areas of greater food availability) will receive lower amounts of fecal phosphorus relative to fecal nitrogen, potentially impacting plant nutrient availability. This finding is noteworthy considering the extinction bias toward larger animals.
          , 
            Nutrients released through herbivore feces have the potential to influence plant-available nutrients and affect primary productivity. However, herbivore species use nutrients in set stoichiometric ratios that vary with body size. Such differences in the ratios at which nutrients are used leads to differences in the ratios at which nutrients are deposited through feces. Thus, local environmental factors that affect the average body size of an herbivore community (such as predation risk and food availability) influence the ratios at which fecal nutrients are supplied to plants. Here, we assess the relationship between herbivore body size and the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios of herbivore feces. We examine how shifts in the average body size of an herbivore community alter the ratios at which nitrogen and phosphorus are supplied to plants and test whether such differences in the stoichiometry of nutrient supply propagate through plants. We show that dung from larger-bodied herbivores contain lower quantities of phosphorus per unit mass and were higher in N:P ratio. We demonstrate that spatial heterogeneity in visibility (a proxy for predation risk and/or food availability) and rainfall (a proxy for food availability), did not affect the overall amount of feces deposited but led to changes in the average body size of the defecating community. Feces deposited in areas of higher rainfall and reduced visibility originated from larger herbivores and were higher in N:P ratios. This indicates that processes that change the size distribution of herbivore communities, such as predation or size-biased extinction, have the potential to alter the nutrient landscape for plants.},

We show that in real food webs, interaction strengths are organized in trophic loops in such a way that long loops contain relatively many weak links. We show and explain mathematically that this patterning enhances stability, because it reduces maximum “loop weight” and thus reduces the amount of intraspecific interaction needed for matrix stability. The patterns are brought about by biomass pyramids, a feature common to most ecosystems. Incorporation of biomass pyramids in 104 food-web descriptions reveals that the low weight of the long loops stabilizes complex food webs. Loop-weight analysis could be a useful tool for exploring the structure and organization of complex communities.},

Remote sensing and variation in landscape features were first used to create a map of the spatial distribution of hotspots, which was tested for accuracy against an independent data set of herbivore observations. Subsequently, we applied structural equation modeling to data on soil fertility and plant quality and quantity across a range of sites. We found that hotspots in Serengeti occur in areas that are relatively flat and located away from rivers, sites where ungulates are less susceptible to predation. Further, hotspots tend to occur in areas where hydrology and rainfall create conditions of relatively low-standing plant biomass, which, coupled with grazing, increases forage quality while decreasing predation risk. Low-standing biomass and higher leaf concentrations of N, Na, and Mg were strong direct predictors of hotspot occurrence. Soil fertility had indirect effects on hotspot occurrence by promoting leaf Na and Mg. The results indicate that landscape features contribute in direct and indirect ways to influence the spatial distribution of hotspots and that the best models incorporated both resource- and predation-related factors.

Important generalizations have emerged in recent decades about conversions by organisms of energy (metabolic theory of ecology) and materials (ecological stoichiometry). However, these new insights leave a key question about ecosystems inadequately addressed: are there basic organizational principles that explain how the interaction structure among species in ecosystems arises? Here we integrate recent contributions to the understanding of how ecosystem organization emerges through ecological autocatalysis (EA), in which species mutually benefit through self-reinforcing circular interaction structures. We seek to generalize the concept of EA by integrating principles from community and ecosystem ecology. We discuss evidence suggesting that ecological autocatalysis is facilitated by resource competition and natural selection, both central principles in community ecology. Furthermore, we suggest that pre-emptive resource competition by consumers and plant resource diversity drive the emergence of autocatalytic loops at the ecosystem level. Subsequently, we describe how interactions between such autocatalytic loops can explain pattern and processes observed at the ecosystem scale, and summarize efforts to model different aspect of the phenomenon. We conclude that EA is a central principle that forms the backbone of the organization in systems ecology, analogous to autocatalytic loops in systems chemistry.},

Metabolic theory of ecology and ecological stoichiometry has helped to integrate population, community and ecosystem field. But it remain to be adressed : are theere basic organizational principales that explain how the interaction structure among species in ecosystem arises ?
A need for new integration of ecosystems, as foodwebs are generally oversimplified (no recycling, no NTI, simplified communities.)
Ecological autocatalysis = self-reinforcing circular species interaction structure, capturing nutrient cycling and linking species with trophic interactions and NTI \& with important self-organizing properties.
Example  = recycling through plant/decomposers/herbivores, which creates a positive feedback with plant/soil ={\textgreater} auto-catalytic (self-reinforcing) loop with positive feedbacks
In these loops, each species change the environmental condition for aech other species in the loop = key role of foundation species (e.g., shrubs) or engineers (e.g. earthworm).
2 components for these cycles : plants and decomposers. Within-cycle competition for these components, will spontaneously lead to more recycling and more production, as competition favor species that growth with the lowest R*..
Ecosystems are better described using alternative autocatalytic loops (e.g., brown-green worlds, slow-fast decomposition). 
Propose two hypothesis for the formation of autocatalytic loops :


pre-emptive competition hypothesis = selection for consumers that utilize resource earlier and produce emergent property of increased autocatalysis



resource diversity hypothesis = diversification of resource used by plants with consumer driven feedbacks on production


e.g. self organized patterns are driven by facilitation within loops and competition between loops due to ecosystem-level competition between alternative autocatalytic sets.
Discuss potential ecosystem selection when species interaction are long-lasting and localized by taking the example of plant-herbivore interaction (cf grazing optimization papers : herbivore can be indirectly postive for plants despite direct antagonism).
This concept yeild to key patterns : ASS, landscape heterogeneity, ecosystem resilience and positive feedbacks.

	abstract = {Significance
            Human activities can alter the behavior of wildlife. Although behavior is known to affect species interactions and demography, behavioral feedbacks are often absent from the types of population models used to understand how ecosystems respond to anthropogenic change. We show that incorporating empirically measured fish feeding behavior into dynamical models of a coral reef alters how the ecosystem responds to fishing. Fish behavior can cause ecosystem collapse in response to less fishing but also, unexpectedly, to subtle differences in the pace at which fishing increases. Behavioral mechanisms similar to those included in our model are present in many ecological systems, and our findings suggest these mechanisms could inform both fundamental understanding and management strategies in such systems.
          , 
            Anthropogenic environmental change is altering the behavior of animals in ecosystems around the world. Although behavior typically occurs on much faster timescales than demography, it can nevertheless influence demographic processes. Here, we use detailed data on behavior and empirical estimates of demography from a coral reef ecosystem to develop a coupled behavioral–demographic ecosystem model. Analysis of the model reveals that behavior and demography feed back on one another to determine how the ecosystem responds to anthropogenic forcing. In particular, an empirically observed feedback between the density and foraging behavior of herbivorous fish leads to alternative stable ecosystem states of coral population persistence or collapse (and complete algal dominance). This feedback makes the ecosystem more prone to coral collapse under fishing pressure but also more prone to recovery as fishing is reduced. Moreover, because of the behavioral feedback, the response of the ecosystem to changes in fishing pressure depends not only on the magnitude of changes in fishing but also on the pace at which changes are imposed. For example, quickly increasing fishing to a given level can collapse an ecosystem that would persist under more gradual change. Our results reveal conditions under which the pace and not just the magnitude of external forcing can dictate the response of ecosystems to environmental change. More generally, our multiscale behavioral–demographic framework demonstrates how high-resolution behavioral data can be incorporated into ecological models to better understand how ecosystems will respond to perturbations.},

Out of this suite of interactions, predator–prey interactions have received most attention. The resulting food webs, however, will always operate simultaneously with networks based on other types of ecological interaction, such as through the activities of ecosystem engineers or mutualistic interactions. Little is known about how to classify, organize and quantify these other ecological networks and their mutual interplay. The aim of this paper is to provide new and testable ideas on how to understand and model ecosystems in which many different types of ecological interaction operate simultaneously. We approach this problem by first identifying six main types of interaction that operate within ecosystems, of which food web interactions are one. Then, we propose that food webs are structured among two main axes of organization: a vertical (classic) axis representing trophic position and a new horizontal ‘ecological stoichiometry’ axis representing decreasing palatability of plant parts and detritus for herbivores and detrivores and slower turnover times. The usefulness of these new ideas is then explored with three very different ecosystems as test cases: temperate intertidal mudflats; temperate short grass prairie; and tropical savannah.},

Competition between organisms that are involved in spatially distinct cycles (between-cycle competition) constitutes another selective force that may lead to more productive and more closed ecosystems. However, these changes in ecosystem properties are only the indirect result of selection for di¡erent functional or demographic traits in the organisms involved. Within-cycle competition maximizes resource-use intensity, while between-cycle competition maximizes the basic reproductive rate.

	abstract = {Abstract
          The meta-ecosystem concept provides a theoretical framework to study the effect of local and regional flows of resources on ecosystem dynamics. Meta-ecosystem theory has hitherto been applied to highly abstract landscapes, and meta-ecosystem dynamics in real-world landscapes remain largely unexplored. River networks constitute a prime example of meta-ecosystems, being characterized by directional resource flows from upstream to downstream communities and from the terrestrial to the aquatic realm. These flows have been thoroughly described by the River Continuum Concept (RCC), a seminal concept in freshwater ecology, stating that observed spatial variations in the relative abundances of invertebrate functional groups reflect systematic shifts in types and locations of food resources, which are in turn determined by the physical attributes of river reaches. Hence, the RCC represents a solid conceptual basis for determining how changes in landscape structure and resource flows will translate into local and regional changes in community composition. Here, we develop and analyse a riverine meta-ecosystem model inspired by the RCC, which builds upon a physically-based landscape model of dendritic river networks. We show that the spatial distributions and regional biomass of invertebrate functional groups observed in stream communities are determined by the spatial structure and scaling attributes of dendritic river networks, as well as by specific rates of resource flows. Neglecting any of these aspects in modelling river meta-ecosystems would result in unrealistic community patterns. Moreover, we observed that high rates of resource flow, for example due to river anthropization, have a negative effect on the regional biomass of all functional groups studied, and can lead to cascading extinctions at the meta-ecosystem scale. Our work paves the way for the development of physically-based meta-ecosystem models to understand the structure and functioning of real-world ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Abstract A decade ago, the general stress paradigm (GSP) aimed to develop a predictive framework linking predator effects to ecosystem function. The GSP was based on the notion that animals, across taxa, exhibit similar physiological responses to predation risk that divert resources from growth and reproduction (which require N-rich biomolecules [i.e., protein]) to emergency functions (which require C-rich biomolecules [e.g., carbohydrates]). The GSP predicts that stressed prey should have a greater dietary demand for C-rich resources, a higher body C:N ratio, and elevated N excretion. Now, 10 yr later, we aim to revisit the GSP?using quantitative meta-analysis to test the original predictions of the GSP and how (1) predator hunting mode, (2) multiple stressors, and (3) prey dietary shifts affect prey stoichiometric responses to predation risk. Our data set was consistent with previous work showing that predation risk increases prey glucocorticoid levels and metabolic rates and decreases prey growth rates. We found that predation risk tended to decrease the fat, carbohydrate, and protein content of prey bodies; increased the C:P and N:P of prey bodies; but had no effect on the C, N, P, or C:N content of prey bodies. Additionally, we found no effect of predation risk on the N content of prey excretions. Prey responses to predation risk were unaffected by multiple stressors or the prey?s ability to shift their diet, but predator hunting mode did affect the nature of prey stoichiometric responses. Specifically, ambush predators decreased prey macronutrient content and suppressed prey growth, and active predators had no effect on prey macronutrient content and a smaller effect on prey growth than ambush predators. The significant effects of predation risk were supported by robust fail-safe numbers, despite the high between-comparison heterogeneity that was found in all analyses. Our findings highlight the need (1) to test the underlying mechanisms and emerging patterns of the GSP in diverse taxa, (2) to explore the mismatch between prey macronutrient content and elemental stoichiometry, and (3) to expand the conceptual framework to include more inducible defenses (e.g., behavioral and morphological) and predator traits.},

Intro is well writen on the links between predation risk and stoichiometry of preys.
With predation risk, it decreases the quantity of fat but also carbohydrate consumed. 
As a consequence, C:P \& N:P increase, but C:N remains unchanged over all studies. Also, no effect on the quantity of N recycled as N is not changed by predation risk.

Thus, the ability to predict the spatial distribution of active subsidies would be useful for ecology and conservation. Previous work modelling active subsidies focused on implicit space or static distributions, which treat passive and active subsidies similarly. Active subsidies are fundamentally different from passive subsidies, because animals can respond to the process of subsidy deposition and ecosystem changes caused by subsidy deposition. We propose addressing this disparity by integrating animal movement and ecosystem ecology to advance active subsidy investigations, make more accurate predictions of subsidy spatial distributions, and enable a mechanistic understanding of subsidy spatial distributions. We review selected quantitative techniques that could be used to accomplish integration and lead to novel insights. The ultimate objective for these types of studies is predictions of subsidy spatial distributions from characteristics of the subsidy and the movement strategy employed by animals that transport subsidies. These advances will be critical in informing the management of ecosystem services, species conservation and ecosystem degradation related to active subsidies.},

We propose a conceptual framework that uniﬁes existing deﬁnitions, and review their most signiﬁcant consequences for the various disciplines. A general deﬁnition of the source and sink concepts that transcends disciplines is based on net ﬂows between the components of a system: a source is a subsystem that is a net exporter of some living or non-living entities of interest, and a sink is a net importer of these entities. Sources and sinks can further be classiﬁed as conditional and unconditional, depending on the intrinsic propensity of subsystems to either produce (source) or absorb (sink) a surplus of these entities under some (conditional) or all (unconditional) conditions. The distinction between conditional and unconditional sources and sinks, however, is strongly context dependent. Sources can turn into sinks, and vice versa, when the context is changed, when systems are subject to temporal ﬂuctuations or evolution, or when they are considered at different spatial and temporal scales. The conservation of ecosystem services requires careful consideration of the source−sink dynamics of multiple ecosystem components. Our synthesis shows that source−sink dynamics has profound consequences for our ability to understand, predict, and manage species and ecosystems in heterogeneous landscapes.},

	abstract = {Desertification threatens 70\% of all dry lands worldwide by diminishing the provision of economic and ecosystem services. However, since long-term vegetation dynamics of semiarid ecosystems are difficult to study, the opportunities to evaluate desertification and degradation properly are limited. In this study, we tailored, calibrated and tested a spatially-explicit simulation model (DINVEG) to describe the long-term dynamics of dominant grass and shrub species in the semiarid Patagonian steppe. We used inverse techniques to identify parameterizations that yield model outputs in agreement with detailed field data, and we performed sensitivity analyses to reveal the main drivers of long-term vegetation dynamics. Whereas many parameterizations (10?45\%) matched single field observations (e.g. grass and shrub cover, species-specific density, aboveground net primary production [ANPP]), only a few parameterizations (0.05\%) yielded simultaneous match of all field observations. Sensitivity analysis pointed to demographic constraints for shrubs and grasses in the emergence and recruitment phase, respectively, which contributed to balanced shrub-grass abundances in the long run. Vegetation dynamics of simulations that matched all field observations were characterized by a stochastic equilibrium. The soil water content in the top layer (0?10 cm) during the emergence period was the strongest predictor of shrub densities and population growth rates and of growth rates of grasses. Grasses controlled the shrub demography because of the resource overlap of grasses with juvenile shrubs (i.e. water content in the top layer). In agreement with field observations, ecosystem function buffered the strong variability in precipitation (a simulated CV in ANPP of 16\% vs CV in precipitation of 33\%). Our results show that seedling emergence and recruitment are critical processes for long-term vegetation dynamics in this steppe. The methods presented here could be widely applied when data for direct parameterization of individual-based models are lacking, but data corresponding to model outputs are available. Our modeling methodology can reduce the need for long-term data sets when answering questions regarding community dynamics.},

Yet these interactions are important for community assembly, especially under stressful environments (e.g. the stress-gradient hypothesis, SGH). To make an explicit link between species interaction theory and SGH patterns, I used a classic resource competition model promoting coexistence between a beneficiary and its facilitator sharing a common resource along a stress gradient. I compared model outcomes for two fundamentally different mechanisms of facilitation (alleviation of resource versus non-resource stress), and also tested the effect of a reciprocal cost of facilitation from the beneficiary. I then tested model's biological relevance using experimental data from two tuber moth species (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) for which facilitation in resource access was previously established. Simulation outcomes revealed that both the mode of facilitation and the incorporation of facilitation costs affected the shape of the facilitation?stress relationship. These predictions are in line with current SGH observations and experiments on both plants and animals and reconcile the frequently reported variability of this relationship in nature. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of model's parameters confirmed the robustness of the modelling framework to uncover the mechanisms responsible for observed species interaction?stress patterns. Finally, when parameterized with tuber moth demographic data, model's results corresponded to observed interaction outcomes along resource stress gradients. Overall, having a common model for plants and animals may simplify assumptions in SGH studies, allow contrasting the shapes of different consumer?resource relationships and specifying the conditions that favour one type of interaction outcome over another.},

In each pathway, indirect eﬀects of predation are localized within discrete areas with measurable spatial and temporal boundaries.

	abstract = {Ecologists use the net biotic interactions among plants as a major factor to predict other ecosystem features, such as species diversity, community structure, or plant atmospheric carbon uptake. By adopting this approach, ecologists have built a giant body of theory founded on observational evidence. However, growing evidence points out that this may not be the right approach.   The literature addressing the biophysical mechanisms underlying the plant interactions is much scarcer. A rising number of scientists claim the need for a mechanistic understanding of plant interactions due to the limitations that a phenomenological approach raises both in empirical and theoretical studies. Scattered studies have recently taken such a mechanistic approach, but we still lack a general theoretical framework to study mechanistically plant interactions.    In this review, we first recapitulate the elementary units of plant interactions, i.e., all the known biophysical processes affected by the presence of an influencing plant and the possible phenotypic responses of plants influenced by those processes. Second, we discuss how a net interaction between two plants emerges from the simultaneous effect of these elementary units. Third, we touch upon the spatial and temporal variability of the net interaction and discuss the links between this variability and the underlying biophysical processes.    We conclude by discussing how to integrate these processes into a mechanistic framework for plant interactions that must necessarily focus on the individual scale and explicitly incorporate the spatial structure of the community and environmental factors: the plant interaction models (PIM). A PIM incorporates a pair or few plants interacting with their physical environment so that the biotic interaction is not imposed but emerges from the model. This type of model can provide concise, mechanistic hypotheses to be tested empirically.   This review calls for a paradigm shift in the ecology of plant interactions, from the classic species interaction study towards a more mechanistic individual-level approach. It also presents a comprehensive foundation for studying the mechanisms underpinning the net interaction between two plants.},

Shrubs are excellent examples; they self-organize to form patterns of mesic patches which provide habitats for herbaceous species. In this paper we present a mathematical model for studying ecosystem engineering by woody plant species in drylands. The model captures various feedbacks between biomass and water including water uptake by plants’ roots and increased water inﬁltration at vegetation patches. Both the uptake and the inﬁltration feedbacks act as mechanisms for vegetation pattern formation, but have opposite effects on the water resource; the former depletes the soil-water content under a vegetation patch, whereas the latter acts to increase it. Varying the relative strength of the two feedbacks we ﬁnd a trade-off between the engineering capacity of a plant species and its resilience to disturbances. We further identify two basic soil-water distributions associated with engineering at the single patch level, hump-shaped and ring-shaped, and discuss the niches they form for herbaceous species. Finally, we study how pattern transitions at the landscape level feedback to the single patch level by affecting engineering strength.},

However, community ecology studies have mainly focused on simple competition and predation systems, and the relative impact of positive interspeciﬁc interactions in shaping communities in a spatial context is not well understood. Here we employ a spatially explicit metacommunity model to investigate the effect of local dispersal on the structure and function of communities in which species are linked through an interaction web comprising mutualism, competition and exploitation. Our results show that function, diversity and interspeciﬁc interactions of locally linked communities undergo a phase transition with changes in the rate of species dispersal. We ﬁnd that low spatial interconnectedness favors the spontaneous emergence of strongly mutualistic communities which are more stable but less productive and diverse. On the other hand, high spatial interconnectedness promotes local biodiversity at the expense of local stability and supports communities with a wide range of interspeciﬁc interactions. We argue that investigations of the relationship between spatial processes and the self-organization of complex interaction webs are critical to understanding the geographic structure of interactions in real landscapes.},

The complex relationships between these counteracting processes – community reassembly and spatial self-organization – have hardly been studied. Using a spatio-temporal model of dryland plant communities and a trait-based approach, we study the response of such communities to increasing water-deficit stress. We first show that spatial patterning acts to reverse shifts from fast-growing species to stress-tolerant species, as well as to reverse functional-diversity loss. We then show that spatial self-organization buffers the impact of further stress on community structure. Finally, we identify multistability ranges of uniform and patterned community states and use them to propose forms of non-uniform ecosystem management that integrate the need for provisioning ecosystem services with the need to preserve community structure.},

	abstract = {Summary Functional diversity (FD) has become a principal concept for revealing mechanisms driving community assembly and ecosystem function. Multiple assembly processes, including abiotic filtering, competition and multi-trophic relationships, operate simultaneously to structure FD. In water-limited plant communities, FD is likely to reflect trade-offs between drought resistance vs. disturbance resistance and competitive ability. We propose a mathematical mechanistic model for understanding the organization and function of water-limited plant communities. The approach captures the interplay between abiotic filtering, below- and above-ground competition and disturbance. We exploit this powerful model to uncover mechanisms underlying changes in functional diversity along stress gradients. Our approach links biomass production and FD to environmental conditions through plant resource capture ability. Functional groups are defined along a single trade-off axis according to investment in capturing light (shoot) vs. water (root). Species growth rate is determined dynamically by the species traits, water availability and grazing stress. We derive biomass production, functional diversity and composition along precipitation and grazing gradients. Model's results revealed several regimes structuring FD along the precipitation gradient: ?Struggle for water? at low precipitation, ?competition for water? at intermediate precipitation and ?competition for light? at high precipitation. We observed a shift in grazing effect on FD from negative at very low precipitation, to positive at higher precipitation. Unimodal FD?grazing intensity relationship was observed under high precipitation, while under low precipitation, FD decreased moderately with increasing grazing intensity. Synthesis. Our model showcases how fundamental tradeoffs in plant traits may drive functional diversity and ecosystem function along environmental gradients. It offers a mechanism through which novel understandings can be obtained regarding the interplay between water stress, below- and above-ground competition and disturbance intensity and history. We discuss further model testing possibilities as well as required empirical work.},

We use ecological niche theory to consider the shortterm (transient) and long-term (equilibrium) effects of improvements in health, agriculture, or efficiency on the abundances of humans, our plant and animal resources, and our natural enemies. We also consider special cases of our model where humans shift to a completely vegetarian diet, or completely eradicate natural enemies. We find that although combinations of health, agriculture, and efficiency improvements tend to support more people and plant resources, they also result in more natural enemies and fewer animal resources. Considering each of these improvements separately reveals that they lead to different, and sometimes opposing, long-term effects. For example, health improvements can reduce pathogen abundances and make it difficult to sustain livestock production, whereas agricultural improvements tend to counterbalance these effects. Our exploratory analysis of a deliberately simple model elucidates trade-offs and feedbacks that could arise from the cascading effects of human activities.},

On an ecological time scale, the model shows that niche construction allows the persistence of plants under infertile soil conditions that would otherwise lead to their extinction. This expansion of plantsÕ niche, however, requires a high enough rate of niche construction and a high enough initial plant biomass to fuel the positive ecological feedback between plants and their soil environment. On an evolutionary time scale, we consider that the rates of niche construction and nutrient uptake coevolve in plants while a trade-off constrains their values. Different evolutionary outcomes are possible depending on the shape of the trade-off. We show that niche construction results in an evolutionary feedback between plants and their soil environment such that plants partially regulate soil nutrient content.

            Getting tipsy
            
              Climate tipping points are conditions beyond which changes in a part of the climate system become self-perpetuating. These changes may lead to abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts with serious implications for humanity. Armstrong McKay
              et al
              . present an updated assessment of the most important climate tipping elements and their potential tipping points, including their temperature thresholds, time scales, and impacts. Their analysis indicates that even global warming of 1°C, a threshold that we already have passed, puts us at risk by triggering some tipping points. This finding provides a compelling reason to limit additional warming as much as possible. —HJS

              INTRODUCTION
              
                Climate tipping points (CTPs) are a source of growing scientific, policy, and public concern. They occur when change in large parts of the climate system—known as tipping elements—become self-perpetuating beyond a warming threshold. Triggering CTPs leads to significant, policy-relevant impacts, including substantial sea level rise from collapsing ice sheets, dieback of biodiverse biomes such as the Amazon rainforest or warm-water corals, and carbon release from thawing permafrost. Nine policy-relevant tipping elements and their CTPs were originally identified by Lenton
                et al
                . (2008). We carry out the first comprehensive reassessment of all suggested tipping elements, their CTPs, and the timescales and impacts of tipping. We also highlight steps to further improve understanding of CTPs, including an expert elicitation, a model intercomparison project, and early warning systems leveraging deep learning and remotely sensed data.
              
            
            
              RATIONALE
              
                Since the original identification of tipping elements there have been substantial advances in scientific understanding from paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies. Additional tipping elements have been proposed (e.g., parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet) and the status of others (e.g., Arctic summer sea ice) has been questioned. Observations have revealed that parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet may have already passed a tipping point. Potential early warning signals of the Greenland ice sheet, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, and Amazon rainforest destabilization have been detected. Multiple abrupt shifts have been found in climate models. Recent work has suggested that up to 15 tipping elements are now active (Lenton
                et al
                ., 2019). Hence it is timely to synthesize this new knowledge to provide a revised shortlist of potential tipping elements and their CTP thresholds.
              
            
            
              RESULTS
              We identify nine global “core” tipping elements which contribute substantially to Earth system functioning and seven regional “impact” tipping elements which contribute substantially to human welfare or have great value as unique features of the Earth system (see figure). Their estimated CTP thresholds have significant implications for climate policy: Current global warming of {\textasciitilde}1.1°C above pre-industrial already lies within the lower end of five CTP uncertainty ranges. Six CTPs become likely (with a further four possible) within the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to {\textless}2°C warming, including collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, die-off of low-latitude coral reefs, and widespread abrupt permafrost thaw. An additional CTP becomes likely and another three possible at the {\textasciitilde}2.6°C of warming expected under current policies.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Our assessment provides strong scientific evidence for urgent action to mitigate climate change. We show that even the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2°C and preferably 1.5°C is not safe as 1.5°C and above risks crossing multiple tipping points. Crossing these CTPs can generate positive feedbacks that increase the likelihood of crossing other CTPs. Currently the world is heading toward {\textasciitilde}2 to 3°C of global warming; at best, if all net-zero pledges and nationally determined contributions are implemented it could reach just below 2°C. This would lower tipping point risks somewhat but would still be dangerous as it could trigger multiple climate tipping points.

	abstract = {A widely assumed but largely untested hypothesis central to ecology and evolutionary biology has been Charles Darwin’s suggestion that closely related species will be more ecologically similar, and thus will compete more strongly with each other than they will with more distantly related species. We provide one of the ﬁrst direct tests of the ‘‘competition-relatedness hypothesis’’ by combining two data sets: the relative competitive ability of 50 vascular plant species competing against 92 competitor species measured in ﬁve multi-species experiments, and measures of the phylogenetic relatedness of these species. In contrast to Darwin’s assertion, there were weak relationships between the strength of competition and phylogenetic relatedness. Across all species studied, the competition-relatedness relationship was weak and not signiﬁcant. This overall lack of pattern masked different responses of monocot and eudicot focal (phytometer) species. When monocots served as the focal (phytometer) species, the intensity of competition increased with the phylogenetic distance separating species, while competition decreased with phylogenetic distance for eudicot phytometers. These results were driven by the monocot-eudicot evolutionary split, such that monocots were poor competitors against eudicots, while eudicots are most strongly suppressed by other eudicots. There was no relationship between relatedness and competition for eudicots competing with other eudicots, while monocots did compete more intensely with closely related monocots than with distantly related monocots. Overall, the relationships between competition intensity and relatedness were weak compared to the strong and consistent relationships between competitive ability and functional traits such as plant size that have been reported by other studies. We suggest that Darwin’s assertion that competition will be strongest among closely related species is not supported by empirical data, at least for the 142 vascular plant species in this study.},

	abstract = {Positive interactions are hypothesized to increase with stress (stress-gradient hypothesis, ‘‘SGH’’), which is deﬁned in terms of standing biomass at the community level. However, recent evidence suggests that facilitation may decrease or remain constant as stress increases. Several reasons for this discrepancy are possible: (i) the outcomes of biotic interactions depend on the component of the ﬁtness considered; (ii) they are inﬂuenced by how vegetation affects local limiting resources; (iii) within a particular community, only species that are deviated from their physiological optima are likely to be facilitated. In a removal experiment, we quantiﬁed the deviations of species in subalpine grassland from their physiological optima, deﬁned here as species-level ‘‘strain’’, and examined whether strain and vegetation effects on local resources can explain the outcome of biotic interactions. The experiment was performed along a gradient of standing biomass driven by contrasting land use and resource availability, and used ﬁve grass species with contrasting traits and ecological optima. Strain for each species was estimated by comparing growth without vegetation (target species only submitted to local abiotic factors) to growth in optimal conditions (under controlled conditions in an experimental garden). The outcomes of biotic interactions, recorded in terms of survival and growth, could be predicted from the data about strain and vegetation effects on local limiting resources (light and water). Only highly strained species were affected by facilitation, which occurred when the surrounding vegetation alleviated the constraining factors. On the other hand, standing biomass was poorly related with the outcomes of biotic interactions. The ‘‘SGH’’ was only partially validated with growth data when strain and vegetation effects co-varied with standing biomass. As a consequence, strain (at species level) represents a mechanistic basis which could improve the prediction of the outcomes of biotic interactions along ecological gradients.},

	abstract = {Much is known about how environmental stress mediates the strength of facilitation, but less is known about how different plant traits affect facilitation. We examined interactions between the shrub Tamarix chinensis and two congeneric forbs ( Suaeda salsa and S. glauca) on the Chinese coast. Although S. salsa and S. glauca are both annuals, morphologically similar, and have synchronous phenologies, they have contrasting adaptive strategies. S. glauca is salt intolerant but competitively superior, and S. salsa is salt tolerant but competitively inferior. Field surveys showed that S. glauca was associated with T. chinensis canopies while S. salsa was more abundant in open areas. A T. chinensis removal experiment showed that S. glauca cover was lower and soil salinity higher after two years in removal than in control plots. Transplant experiments showed that S. salsa performance under T. chinensis canopies was reduced by competition from S. glauca and T. chinensis , while in open areas S. glauca was not affected by S. salsa competition. Thus, contrasting competitive abilities and stress tolerances of S. glauca and S. salsa underlie their facilitative and competitive interactions with T. chinensis , suggesting that plant strategies are critical to the outcome of species interactions.

We used long-term vegetation monitoring results from 39 large plots across four protected sites in the Sonoran Desert region to determine how plant species have responded to past climate variability. This cross-site analysis identiﬁed the plant species and functional types susceptible to climate change, the magnitude of their responses, and potential climate thresholds. In the relatively mesic mesquite savanna communities, perennial grasses declined with a decrease in annual precipitation, cacti increased, and there was a reversal of the Prosopis velutina expansion experienced in the 20th century in response to increasing mean annual temperature (MAT). In the more xeric Arizona Upland communities, the dominant leguminous tree, Cercidium microphyllum, declined on hillslopes, and the shrub Fouquieria splendens decreased, especially on south- and west-facing slopes in response to increasing MAT. In the most xeric shrublands, the codominant species Larrea tridentata and its hemiparasite Krameria grayi decreased with a decrease in cool season precipitation and increased aridity, respectively. This regional-scale assessment of plant species response to recent climate variability is critical for forecasting future shifts in plant community composition, structure, and productivity.},

Here we use simulations to test the statistical performances of the two approaches that are the most widely used in the ﬁeld: Mantel tests and the Phylogenetic Bipartite Linear Model (PBLM). Mantel tests investigate the correlation between phylogenetic distances and dissimilarities in sets of interacting partners, while PBLM is a process-based approach that relies on strong assumptions about how interactions evolve. We ﬁnd that PBLM often detects a phylogenetic signal when it should not. Simple Mantel tests instead have infrequent false positives and moderate statistical power; however, they often artifactually detect that closely related species interact with dissimilar partners. Partial Mantel tests, which are used to partial out the phylogenetic signal in the number of partners, actually fail at correcting for this confounding eﬀect, and we instead recommend evaluating the signiﬁcance of Mantel tests with network permutations constraining the number of partners. We also explore the ability of simple Mantel tests to analyze clade- speciﬁc phylogenetic signals.

We show that the effects of these two resource-mediated positive interactions are similar and additive. We predict that positive interactions shift the transition points between different species compositions along environmental gradients and that realized niche widths will expand or shrink. Furthermore, continuous transitions between different community compositions can become discontinuous and bistability or tristability can occur.

The former acts to increase interspeciﬁc competition while the latter favors facilitation. The net interspeciﬁc interaction is determined by the relative strength of the two feedbacks. The model is used to highlight new mechanisms of plant-interaction change by studying factors that tilt the balance between the two feedbacks. Factors addressed in this study include environmental stresses and patch dynamics of the woody species. The model is further used to study mechanisms of species-diversity change by taking into consideration tradeoffs in species traits and conditions giving rise to irregular patch patterns.},

Logistic growth and linear mortality. 3 feedbacks : 

- Infiltration increases with vegetation

- Shading feedback : decrease in evaporation with plant density

- Root augmentation
Case of woody-herbaceous ecosystems :

herbaceous : more growth but more mortality and less biomass compared to woody plant (shrub).
Woody alone : classical bifurcation diagram.

Herbaceous cannot survive when precipitation is high(excluded by woody by competition) and not when precipitations are low, in this case only woody is present and can shift abruptly to bare soil state.
Also investigates the SGH by comparing soil content in bare or under woody and find that facilitation increases with stress.
When patches are sparsed, woody excludes herbaceous sp.
When patches are large, coexistence is possible and negatively impact woody patch size.
Close patches -{\textgreater} intraspecific competition decreases the patch size and lead to facilitation and coexistence with the herbaceous species.

Irregular patterns can accommodate both species making them coexist

The pattern shape (band to spotted) can allow species to coexist.

Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difﬁcult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difﬁcult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efﬁcient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a uniﬁed framework for statistical modelling.},

	abstract = {The constant provision of plant productivity is integral to supporting the liability of ecosystems and human wellbeing in global drylands. Drylands are paradigmatic examples of systems prone to experiencing abrupt changes in their functioning. Indeed, space-for-time substitution approaches suggest that abrupt changes in plant productivity are widespread, but this evidence is less clear using observational time series or experimental data at a large scale. Studying the prevalence and, most importantly, the unknown drivers of abrupt (rather than gradual) dynamical patterns in drylands may help to unveil hotspots of current and future dynamical instabilities in drylands. Using a 20-y global satellite-derived temporal assessment of dryland Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we show that 50\% of all dryland ecosystems exhibiting gains or losses of NDVI are characterized by abrupt positive/negative temporal dynamics. We further show that abrupt changes are more common among negative than positive NDVI trends and can be found in global regions suffering recent droughts, particularly around critical aridity thresholds. Positive abrupt dynamics are found most in ecosystems with low seasonal variability or high aridity. Our work unveils the high importance of climate variability on triggering abrupt shifts in vegetation and it provides missing evidence of increasing abruptness in systems intensively managed by humans, with low soil organic carbon contents, or around specific aridity thresholds. These results highlight that abrupt changes in dryland dynamics are very common, especially for productivity losses, pinpoint global hotspots of dryland vulnerability, and identify drivers that could be targeted for effective dryland management.},

	abstract = {Ecology makes an increasing use of complex simulation models. As more processes and model parameters are added, a comprehensive model calibration with process-level data becomes costly and predictions of such complex models are therefore often restricted to local applications. In this context, inverse modelling techniques enable to calibrate models with data of the same type than model outputs (thereafter called population data for the sake of clarity, although other data types can be used according to model outputs), which are usually simpler to collect and more readily available. This study aims at demonstrating how such data can be used to improve ecological models, by recalibrating the most inﬂuential parameters of a complex model in a Bayesian framework, and at providing general guidelines for potential users of this approach. We used the individual-based and spatially explicit forest dynamics simulation model Samsara2 as a case study. Considering the results of an initial calibration and of a sensitivity analysis as prerequisites, we assessed whether we could use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to recalibrate a subset of parameters on historical management data collected in forests with various ecological conditions. We propose guidelines to answer three questions that potential users of the approach will encounter: (1) How many and which parameters are we able to recalibrate accurately with such low-informative data? (2) How many ABC simulations are required to obtain a reasonable convergence of the parameter posterior estimates? (3) What is the variability of model predictions following the recalibration? In our case study, we found that two parameters by species could be recalibrated with forest management data and that a relatively low number of simulations (20,000) was sufﬁcient. We ﬁnally pointed out that the variability of model predictions was largely due to model stochasticity, and much less to ABC recalibration and initial calibration uncertainties. Combining direct process-level calibration to ABC recalibration of the most inﬂuential parameters opens the door to interesting modelling improvements, such as the calibration of forest dynamics along environmental gradients. This general approach should thus help improve both accuracy and generality of model-based ecological predictions.},

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

	abstract = {Dynamic vegetation models provide process-based explanations of the dynamics and the distribution of plant ecosystems. They offer signiﬁcant advantages over static, correlative modelling approaches, particularly for ecosystems that are outside their equilibrium due to global change or climate change. A persistent problem, however, is their parameterization. Parameters and processes of dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are traditionally determined independently of the model, while model outputs are compared to empirical data for validation and informal model comparison only. But ﬁeld data for such independent estimates of parameters and processes are often difﬁcult to obtain, and the desire to include better descriptions of processes such as biotic interactions, dispersal, phenotypic plasticity and evolution in future vegetation models aggravates limitations related to the current parameterization paradigm. In this paper, we discuss the use of Bayesian methods to bridge this gap. We explain how Bayesian methods allow direct estimates of parameters and processes, encoded in prior distributions, to be combined with inverse estimates, encoded in likelihood functions. The combination of direct and inverse estimation of parameters and processes allows a much wider range of vegetation data to be used simultaneously, including vegetation inventories, species traits, species distributions, remote sensing, eddy ﬂux measurements and palaeorecords. The possible reduction of uncertainty regarding structure, parameters and predictions of DVMs may not only foster scientiﬁc progress, but will also increase the relevance of these models for policy advice.},

In this paper, we discuss and apply an ABC method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to estimate parameters of dynamical models. We show that ABC SMC provides information about the inferability of parameters and model sensitivity to changes in parameters, and tends to perform better than other ABC approaches. The algorithm is applied to several well-known biological systems, for which parameters and their credible intervals are inferred. Moreover, we develop ABC SMC as a tool for model selection; given a range of different mathematical descriptions, ABC SMC is able to choose the best model using the standard Bayesian model selection apparatus.},

Example 1 : 

LV with 8 observation for each species.
For ABC-rejection algorithm = 14.1 million data point, for ABC-MCMC = 50 000 data point and for ABC-SMC {\textasciitilde} 50 000 too.


Same results for the 3 algorithms but way faster for the last 2 methods
Example 2: Stochastic LV

Similar but this time 3 rates are needed to be estimated.

	abstract = {Vegetation patterning in water-limited and other resource-limited ecosystems highlights spatial self-organization processes as potentially key drivers of community assembly. These processes provide insight into predictable landscape-level relationships between organisms and their abiotic environment in the form of regular and irregular patterns of biota and resources. However, two aspects have largely been overlooked; the roles played by plant – soil-biota feedbacks and allelopathy in spatial self-organization, and their potential contribution, along with plant-resource feedbacks, to community assembly through spatial self-organization. Here, we expand the drivers of spatial self-organization from a focus on plant-resource feedbacks to include plant – soil-biota feedbacks and allelopathy, and integrate concepts of nonlinear physics and community ecology to generate a new hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, below-ground processes can affect community assemblages through two types of spatial self-organization, global and local. The former occurs simultaneously across whole ecosystems, leading to self-organized patterns of biota, allelochemicals and resources, and niche partitioning. The latter occurs locally in ecotones, and determines ecotone structure and motion, invasion dynamics, and species coexistence. Studies of the two forms of spatial self-organization are important for understanding the organization of plant communities in drier climates which are likely to involve spatial patterning or re-patterning. Such studies are also important for developing new practices of ecosystem management, based on local manipulations at ecotones, to slow invasion dynamics or induce transitions from transitive to intransitive networks of interspeciﬁc interactions which increase species diversity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

2 scale of self-organization : global (self-organized patterns) and local (ecotones, species coexistence, invasion dynamics)

Local self-organization may form in systems where multiple states co-occur
Vegetation patterning in drylands is global due to  SDF (e.g. Turing pattern, instability).

But can also occur locally at ecotones or fronts which separate the domains of different ecosystem states.
Feedbacks between vegetation patterns and community assembly (see Bera Elife 2021). Patterns can affect community assembly by enhancing recruitment and development of other plant species which feedback on the patterns formed
Big part on classical vegetation patterns
Then move to ecosystem engineering and self-organized niche partitioning. Example using Gilad community 2007 TPB paper
Shrub, woody or facilitating vegetation have the potential to create niches that drive self-organization of populations and communities.

This create conditions for survival and growht of different groups of species (depending on the type of the niche created by the species).
Plant-soil feedbacks + allelopathy -{\textgreater} negative feedbacks which can induce change in spatial patterns

But 

There is also positive feedbacks driven by soil/vegetation which may result in species exclusion and decrease of species diversity. But patterns may allow diversity by excluding locally species and allowing them to colonize bare soil
Many empirical example with species.
More locally, ecotones separate spatial domains of alternative stable states. This corresponds to local multistability. Multistability arises due to feedbacks stabilizing alternative stable states.
2 manisfestations of ecotones = desertification and invasion fronts. 

This is promising research direction of reversing invasion of desert state.
Possible factors controlling front vegetation = intransivité.
Multistability can appear as a result of strong interspecific competition. FOr instance in intrasive configurations.

This requires an understanding of ecological resilience: the ability of an ecosystem to return to the same state following a perturbation, which can strongly depend on species interactions across trophic levels. We use a structured model of a temperate rocky reef to explore how multi-trophic level fisheries impact ecological resilience. Increasing fishing mortality of prey (urchins) has a minor effect on equilibrium biomass of kelp, urchins, and spiny lobster predators, but increases resilience by reducing the range of predator harvest rates at which alternative stable states are possible. Size-structured predation on urchins acts as the feedback maintaining each state. Our results demonstrate that the resilience of ecosystems strongly depends on the interactive effects of predator and prey harvest in multi-trophic level fisheries, which are common in marine ecosystems but are unaccounted for by traditional management.},

Using a size-structured, individual-based model we show that catastrophic population collapses may nonetheless be an intrinsic property of many communities, because of two general aspects of individual life history: size- and food-dependent individual growth and individual mortality decreasing with body size. Positive density dependence, characteristic for depensatory growth mechanisms and catastrophic behavior, results as a direct and robust consequence of the interplay between these individual life-history traits, which are commonly found in many species.},

Nevertheless, highly diverse ecosystems have collapsed, as did Lake Victoria’s ecosystem of cichlids or Caribbean coral reefs. We try to gain insight to this paradox, by analyzing a simple model of a diverse community where each competing species inflicts a small mortality pressure on an introduced predator. High diversity strengthens this feedback and prevents invasion of the introduced predator. After a gradual loss of native species, the introduced predator can escape control and the system collapses into a contrasting, invaded, low-diversity state. Importantly, we find that a diverse system that has high complementarity gains in resilience, whereas a diverse system with high functional redundancy gains in resistance. Loss of resilience can display early-warning signals of a collapse, but loss of resistance not. Our results emphasize the need for multiple approaches to studying the functioning of ecosystems, as managing an ecosystem requires understanding not only the threats it is vulnerable to but also pressures it appears resistant to.},

We performed a two-year experiment where spatial early warning indicators were assessed in transects where the canopy was differentially removed (from 0 to 100\%). Unlike Moran correlation coefficient at lag1, spatial variance, skewness, and spatial spectra at low frequency increased along the gradient of canopy degradation and dropped, or did not show any further increase beyond the transition point from a canopy- to a turf-dominated state (100\% canopy removal).

	abstract = {Theory suggests that ecological systems exhibit a pronounced slow down in their dynamics, known as ‘critical slowing down’ (CSD), before they undergo regime shifts or critical transitions. As a result of CSD, ecosystems exhibit characteristic temporal and spatial changes which can be used as early warning signals of imminent regime shifts. For temporal data, statistical methods to detect these generic indicators of ecosystem resilience are well developed. However, for spatial data, despite a well developed theoretical framework, statistical methods such as data pre-processing and null models to detect EWS are relatively poorly developed. In this manuscript, we investigate the case of a common type of ecological spatial dataset which consists of binary values at each location (e.g. occupied/unoccupied, tree/grass or coralline/bleached). We employ a cellular-automaton based spatially-explicit model which generates data that mimics remotely sensed or ﬁeld collected high-resolution spatial data with a binary classiﬁcation of the state variables at each location. We demonstrate that trends in two spatial metrics, spatial variance and spatial skewness, of such binary spatial data lead to false, failed or misleading signals of transitions. We ﬁnd that, two other indicators, spatial autocorrelation at lag-1 and spectral density ratio, accurately reﬂect CSD even with binary spatial data. To overcome the problems associated with detection of EWS using spatial variance and skewness, we investigate a data pre-processing method called ‘coarse-graining’ which is inspired from the physics literature on phase transitions. Coarse-graining reduces the spatial resolution of data by averaging state variables over small scales. Yet, it enables detection of CSD-based spatial indicators of impending critical transitions. In summary, our study provides a theoretical basis, and rigorous evaluation, of coarse-graining as a pre-processing step to analyse spatial datasets with discrete state classiﬁcations.},

Similarly for spatial skewness.
Coarse-graining = measure of densities, statistical properties of the landscape over a given distance.

For distance = 1, there is no coarse-graining while for distance = N, there is coarse graining

This method homogeneise densities but make it more continuous. 
Use the same model as in Eby
Without coase-graining there can be false positive EWS with the variance while with coarse-graining there is no false positive
Spatial skewness is expected to decrease as we approach tipping point as perturbation to the low density state takes much longer to decary than ones to a higher biomass state.
Acf and spectral properties perform well even without coarse graining.

We analyse the role of recycling, predation and competition and ﬁnd that ecosystem stability can be estimated by the strengths of the shortest positive and negative predator-prey feedbacks in the network. We show the generality of our explanation with another 21 observed food webs, comparing random-type parameterisations of interaction strengths with empirical ones.

	abstract = {Criticality has been proposed as a mechanism for the emergence of complexity, life, and computation, as it exhibits a balance between robustness and adaptability. In classic models of complex systems where structure and dynamics are considered homogeneous, criticality is restricted to phase transitions, leading either to robust (ordered) or adaptive (chaotic) phases in most of the parameter space. Many real-world complex systems, however, are not homogeneous. Some elements change in time faster than others, with slower elements (usually the most relevant) providing robustness, and faster ones being adaptive. Structural patterns of connectivity are also typically heterogeneous, characterized by few elements with many interactions and most elements with only a few. Here we take a few traditionally homogeneous dynamical models and explore their heterogeneous versions, ﬁnding evidence that heterogeneity extends criticality. Thus, parameter ﬁne-tuning is not necessary to reach a phase transition and obtain the beneﬁts of (homogeneous) criticality. Simply adding heterogeneity can extend criticality, making the search/evolution of complex systems faster and more reliable. Our results add theoretical support for the ubiquitous presence of heterogeneity in physical, social, and technological systems, as natural selection can exploit heterogeneity to evolve complexity “for free”. In artiﬁcial systems and biological design, heterogeneity may also be used to extend the parameter range that allows for criticality.},

Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.},

It has been recently proposed that competition may drive the spontaneous emergence of niches comprising clusters of similar species, in contrast with the dominant paradigm of greater-than-chance species differences. However, current clustering theory relies largely on heuristic rather than mechanistic models. Furthermore, studies of models incorporating demographic stochasticity and immigration, two key players in community assembly, did not observe clusters. Here we demonstrate clustering under partitioning of resources, partitioning of environmental gradients, and a competition-colonization tradeoff. We show that clusters are robust to demographic stochasticity, and can persist under immigration. While immigration may sustain clusters that are otherwise transient, too much dilutes the pattern. In order to detect and quantify clusters in nature, we introduce and validate metrics which have no free parameters nor require arbitrary trait binning, and weigh species by their abundances rather than relying on a presence-absence count. By generalizing beyond the circumstances where clusters have been observed, our study contributes to establishing them as an update to classical trait patterning theory.},

In the emergent neutrality model, species with similar niches and competitive ability self-organise into clusters. In the hidden-niche model, unaccounted-for niche differences stabilise coexistence within clusters. Finally, clustering may occur through alliances of species that facilitate each other. We tested these hypotheses using population-growth models that consider interspecific interactions parameterised for 35 species using field data. We simulated the expected community dynamics under different species-interaction scenarios. Interspecific competition was weaker within rather than between clusters, suggesting that differences in unmeasured niche axes stabilise coexistence within clusters. Direct facilitation did not drive clustering. In contrast, indirect facilitation seemingly promoted species alliances in clusters whose members suppressed common competitors in other clusters. Such alliances have been overlooked in the literature on clustering, but may arise easily when within cluster competition is weak.},

Yet there are ample reasons to suspect that climate change could result in a global catastrophe. Analyzing the mechanisms for these extreme consequences could help galvanize action, improve resilience, and inform policy, including emergency responses. We outline current knowledge about the likelihood of extreme climate change, discuss why understanding bad-to-worst cases is vital, articulate reasons for concern about catastrophic outcomes, define key terms, and put forward a research agenda. The proposed agenda covers four main questions: 1) What is the potential for climate change to drive mass extinction events? 2) What are the mechanisms that could result in human mass mortality and morbidity? 3) What are human societies' vulnerabilities to climate-triggered risk cascades, such as from conflict, political instability, and systemic financial risk? 4) How can these multiple strands of evidence—together with other global dangers—be usefully synthesized into an “integrated catastrophe assessment”?

Ecological interactions form complex networks with multiple direct and indirect paths through which the impacts of an extinction may propagate.

Using an approach initially developed for the study of information flow, we estimate indirect effects in plant–pollinator networks and find that even those species with several direct interactions may have much of their influence over others through long indirect paths. Next, we perform extinction simulations in those networks and show that although traditional connectivity metrics fail in the prediction of coextinction patterns, accounting for indirect interaction paths allows predicting species’ vulnerability to the cascading effects of an extinction event.

	abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity plays a crucial role in the coexistence of species. Despite recognition of the importance of self-organization in creating environmental heterogeneity in otherwise uniform landscapes, the effects of such self-organized pattern formation in promoting coexistence through facilitation are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of pattern formation on species interactions and community spatial structure in ecosystems with limited underlying environmental heterogeneity, using self-organized patchiness of the aquatic macrophyte Callitriche platycarpa in streams as a model system. Our theoretical model predicted that pattern formation in aquatic vegetation – due to feedback interactions between plant growth, water flow and sedimentation processes – could promote species coexistence, by creating heterogeneous flow conditions inside and around the plant patches. The spatial plant patterns predicted by our model agreed with field observations at the reach scale in naturally vegetated rivers, where we found a significant spatial aggregation of two macrophyte species around C. platycarpa. Field transplantation experiments showed that C. platycarpa had a positive effect on the growth of both beneficiary species, and the intensity of this facilitative effect was correlated with the heterogeneous hydrodynamic conditions created within and around C. platycarpa patches. Our results emphasize the importance of self-organized patchiness in promoting species coexistence by creating a landscape of facilitation, where new niches and facilitative effects arise in different locations. Understanding the interplay between competition and facilitation is therefore essential for successful management of biodiversity in many ecosystems.},

In nature, however, diverse interactions co-occur, each of them forming a layer of a ‘multilayer’ network. Data including information on multiple interactions has recently started to emerge, giving us the opportunity to have a ﬁrst glance at possible commonalities in the structure of these networks. We studied the structural features of 44 tripartite ecological networks from the literature, each composed of two layers of interactions (e.g. herbivory, parasitism, pollination), and investigated their fragility to species losses. We found that the way in which the different layers of interactions are connected to each other affect how perturbations spread in ecological communities. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple interactions simultaneously to better gauge the robustness of ecological communities to species loss and to more reliably identify the species that are important for robustness.},

However, most ﬁeld assessments of the ecological impacts of grazing on drylands conducted to date have been carried out at local or regional scales and have focused on single ecosystem attributes (e.g., plant productivity) or particular taxa (mainly aboveground, e.g., plants). Here we introduce the BIODESERT survey, the ﬁrst systematic ﬁeld survey devoted to evaluating the joint impacts of grazing by domestic livestock and climate on the structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems worldwide. This collaborative global survey was carried out between 2016 and 2019 and has involved the collection of ﬁeld data and plant, biocrust, and soil samples from a total of 326 45 m × 45 m plots from 98 sites located in 25 countries from 6 continents. Here we describe the major characteristics and the ﬁeld protocols used in this survey. We also introduce the organizational aspects followed, as these can be helpful to everyone wishing to establish a global collaborative network of researchers. The BIODESERT survey provides baseline data to assess the current status of dryland rangelands worldwide and the impacts of grazing on these key ecosystems, and it constitutes a good example of the power of collaborative research networks to study the ecology of our planet using much-needed ﬁeld data.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems can undergo abrupt transitions between alternative stable states when the driver crosses a critical threshold. Dynamical systems theory shows that when ecosystems approach the point of loss of stability associated with these transitions, they take a long time to recover from perturbations, a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. This generic feature of dynamical systems can offer early warning signals of abrupt transitions. However, these signals are qualitative and cannot quantify the thresholds of drivers at which transition may occur. Here, we propose a method to estimate critical thresholds from spatial data. We show that two spatial metrics, spatial variance and autocorrelation of ecosystem state variable, computed along driver gradients can be used to estimate critical thresholds. First, we investigate cellular-automaton models of ecosystem dynamics that show a transition from a high-density state to a bare state. Our models show that critical thresholds can be estimated as the ecosystem state and the driver values at which spatial variance and spatial autocorrelation of the ecosystem state are maximum. Next, to demonstrate the application of the method, we choose remotely sensed vegetation data (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) from regions in central Africa and northeast Australia that exhibit alternative states in woody cover. We draw transects (8 9 90 km) that span alternative stable states along rainfall gradients. Our analyses of spatial variance and autocorrelation of EVI along transects yield estimates of critical thresholds. These estimates match reasonably well with those obtained by an independent method that uses large-scale (250 9 200 km) spatial data sets. Given the generality of the principles that underlie our method, our method can be applied to a variety of ecosystems that exhibit alternative stable states.},

Here we experimentally address how spatial resource gradients and connectivity affect resource use efﬁciency (RUE) and stoichiometry in marine phytoplankton as well as the community composition at local and regional scales. We created gradostat metaecosystems consisting of ﬁve linearly interconnected patches, which were arranged either in countercurrent gradients of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply or with a uniform spatial distribution of nutrients and which had either low or high connectivity. Gradient metaecosystems were characterized by higher remaining N and P concentrations (and N∶P ratios) than uniform ones, a difference reduced by higher connectivity. The position of the patch in the gradient strongly constrained elemental stoichiometry, local biovolume production, and RUE. As expected, algal carbon (C)∶N, biovolume, and N-speciﬁc RUE decreased toward the N-rich end of the gradient metaecosystem, whereas the opposite was observed for most of the gradient for C∶P, N∶P, and P-speciﬁc RUE. However, at highest N∶P supply, unexpectedly low C∶P, N∶P, and P-speciﬁc RUE values were found, indicating that the low availability of P inhibited efﬁcient use of N and biovolume production. Consequently, gradient metaecosystems had lower overall biovolume at the regional scale. Whereas treatment effects on local richness were weak, gradients were characterized by higher dissimilarity in species composition. Thus, the stoichiometry of resource supply and spatial connectivity between patches appeared as decisive elements constraining phytoplankton composition and functioning in metaecosystems.},

Furthermore, simultaneous N and P enrichment produces strongly positive synergistic responses in all three environments. Thus, contrary to some prevailing paradigms, freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems are surprisingly similar in terms of N and P limitation.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present the R package \&lt;strong\&gt;deSolve\&lt;/strong\&gt; to solve initial value problems (IVP) written as ordinary differential equations (ODE), differential algebraic equations (DAE) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations (PDE), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the \&lt;strong\&gt;ODEPACK\&lt;/strong\&gt; package (LSODE, LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR), DVODE and DASPK2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e.g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the benefits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R’s high-level procedures. \&lt;strong\&gt;deSolve\&lt;/strong\&gt; is the successor of package \&lt;strong\&gt;odesolve\&lt;/strong\&gt; which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

These are then invaded with randomly constructed invaders drawn from the same distribution as the residents. The invasion success rate and the fate of the residents are determined as a function of community- and species-level properties. I show that the probability of colonization success for an invader decreases with community size and the average strength of competition (a). Communities composed of many strongly interacting species limit the invasion possibilities of most similar species. These communities, even for a superior invading competitor, set up a sort of "activation barrier" that repels invaders when they invade at low numbers. This "priority effect" for residents is not assumed a priori in my description for the individual population dynamics of these species; rather it emerges because species-rich and strongly interacting species sets have alternative stable states that tend to disfavor species at low densities. These models point to community-level rather than invader-level properties as the strongest determinant of differences in invasion success. The probability of extinction for a resident species increases with community size, and the probability of successful colonization by the invader decreases. Thus an equilibrium community size results wherein the probability of a resident species' extinction just balances the probability of an invader's addition. Given the distribution of a it is now possible to predict the equilibrium species number. The results provide a logical framework for an island-biogeographic theory in which species turnover is low even in the face of persistent invasions and for the protection of fragile native species from invading exotics.},

Both factors contribute to active root segregation, affecting neighbours’ growth. In ﬁeld and greenhouse experiments we investigated the belowground zone of inﬂuence of Stipa tenacissima, a tussock-forming grass which is the dominant species in many semiarid communities of the western Mediterranean Basin. Sometimes tussocks show a fringe nearly devoid of annual plants, most likely caused by competition or interference. Fringe size was a function of water availability, so that the more water available the smaller the fringe and vice-versa. Aboveground mass of annual plants was higher in gaps than in the fringe, but root mass was higher in the fringe. More species emerged in soils from gaps than in soils from the fringe, and productivity was ten times higher in soils from gaps than in soils from the fringe. Growth of barley plants was inhibited in the vicinity of S. tenacissima tussocks. S. tenacissima produced a belowground zone of inﬂuence around the tussock through resource depletion, particularly water, but also likely through root exudates. Both mechanisms might inhibit the establishment of other annual and grass species within the fringe. Fringe area has important effects for plant establishment, inﬂuencing population and community dynamics in these semiarid environments.},

from the habitat of higher fertility or diversity to the habitat with
lower fertility or diversity, boosting ecosystem functioning in the
receiving habitat. By explicitly modelling stocks and interconnecting
fluxes we could replicate empirically observed effects of spatial
subsidies, such as biomass distribution shifts and effect attenuation,

We show that this causes higher plasticity to evolve on the island than on the continent at migration-selection equilibrium, assuming genetic variation of reaction norms is such that phenotypic variance is higher on the island, where phenotypes are not canalized. For a species distributed continuously in space along an environmental gradient, higher plasticity evolves at the edges of the geographic range, and in environments where phenotypes are not canalized. Constant or evolving partially adaptive plasticity also alleviates maladaptation owing to gene ﬂow in a heterogeneous environment and produces higher mean ﬁtness and larger population size in marginal populations, preventing them from becoming sinks and facilitating invasion of new habitats. Our results shed light on the widely observed involvement of partially adaptive plasticity in phenotypic clines, and on the mechanisms causing geographic variation in plasticity.},

Turing’s activator–inhibitor principle is considered the central paradigm to explain such patterns. According to this principle, local activation combined with long-range inhibition of growth and survival is an essential prerequisite for pattern formation. Here, we show that the physical principle of phase separation, solely based on density-dependent movement by organisms, represents an alternative class of self-organized pattern formation in ecology. Using experiments with self-organizing mussel beds, we derive an empirical relation between the speed of animal movement and local animal density. By incorporating this relation in a partial differential equation, we demonstrate that this model corresponds mathematically to the well-known Cahn–Hilliard equation for phase separation in physics. Finally, we show that the predicted patterns match those found both in field observations and in our experiments. Our results reveal a principle for ecological self-organization, where phase separation rather than activation and inhibition processes drives spatial pattern formation.},

Self-organized spatial patterns are important determinants of the functioning of ecosystems, promoting the growth and survival of the involved organisms, and affecting the capacity of the organisms to cope with changing environmental conditions. The predominant explanation for self-organized pattern formation is spatial heterogeneity in establishment, growth and mortality, resulting from the self-organization processes. A number of recent studies, however, have revealed that movement of organisms can be an important driving process creating extensive spatial patterning in many ecosystems. Here, we review studies that detail movement-based pattern formation in contrasting ecological settings. Our review highlights that a common principle, where movement of organisms is density-dependent, explains observed spatial regular patterns in all of these studies. This principle, well known to physics as the Cahn–Hilliard principle of phase separation, has so-far remained unrecognized as a general mechanism for self-organized complexity in ecology. Using the examples presented in this paper, we explain how this movement principle can be discerned in ecological settings, and clarify how to test this mechanism experimentally. Our study highlights that animal movement, both in isolation and in unison with other processes, is an important mechanism for regular pattern formation in ecosystems.},

Sperm migration is also subject to this theory

 In phase separation, there is no such unstable background state, but patterns arise from the spatial mixing of two stable states, creating patches of either high or low biomass. There are, in general terms, only local attractive or repulsive forces among individuals that cause biased movement in case of phase separation, and that drive the dynamic development of the patterns

Our objective was to identify why grazing causes increases in the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in some cases, but decreases in others. The immediate effect of grazing on heterogeneity depends on the interaction between the spatial pattern of grazing and the preexisting spatial pattern of vegetation. Depending on the scale of observation and on the factors that determine animal distribution, grazing patterns may be stronger or weaker than vegetation patterns, or may mirror the spatial structure of vegetation. For each possible interaction between these patterns, we make a prediction about resulting changes in the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation. Case studies from the literature support our predictions, although ecosystems characterized by strong plantsoil interactions present important exceptions. While the processes by which grazing causes increases in heterogeneity are clear, how grazing leads to decreases in heterogeneity is less so. To explore how grazing can consistently dampen the fine-scale spatial patterns of competing plant species, we built a cell-based simulation model that features two competing plant species, different grazing patterns, and different sources of vegetation pattern. Only the simulations that included neighborhood interactions as a source of vegetation pattern produced results consistent with the predictions we derived from the literature review.},

De nombreux travaux théoriques suggèrent que les propriétés de ces structures spatiales sont affectées par les pressions environnementales et pourraient ainsi servir de signaux d’alerte pour l’évaluation de la perte de résilience des écosystèmes arides. Nous avons évalué ces indicateurs sur des images satellites de végétation correspondant aux sites de relevés de terrain des projets européens BIOCOM et BIODESERT à travers toute la planète. Nous avons utilisé ces données pour interroger les liens entre structure spatiale d’une part, et aridité et intensité du pâturage d’autre part. Nous avons également exploré si la structure spatiale pouvait être utilisée pour identiﬁer des sites considérés comme dégradés selon un indicateur de fonctionnement des écosystèmes, la multifonctionnalité. Nos résultats suggèrent que la structure spatiale dépend bien des pressions d’aridité et de pâturage, et que la particularité de l’arrangement spatial de la végétation reﬂète même une interaction entre aridité et pâturage. Cependant, la structure spatiale seule ne permet pas de prédire correctement l’état de fonctionnement des sites.

	title = {Conséquences des interactions entre voies vertes et brunes sur la stabilité des réseaux trophiques},
	abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to understand the implications of the relationships between green and brown food webs on the stability and functioning of food webs. The interactions between these two food webs, based respectively on photosynthesis and the consumption of dead organic matter, are essential for the functioning of ecosystems: one produces organic matter from mineral nutrients and the other one recycles the nutrients contained in dead organic matter. I address this by using two theoretical models and an experimental study. My ﬁrst model shows that the feedback loop induced by nutrient cycling in an exclusively green food web has a stabilising eﬀect on species dynamics in a food chain and an enrichment eﬀect due to the excretion of nutrients that are available again for primary producers. However, only the enrichment eﬀect, which is destabilising, persists in a food web model. My second model integrates a true brown food web and shows that this food web is more destabilised than the green food web when nutrient availability increases. This eﬀect is ampliﬁed if most of nutrients are excreted as detritus that destabilises the brown food web through an enrichment eﬀect. This model also shows that consumer survival is improved when they can consume prey from both green and brown food webs. My experiment in aquatic mesocosms enabled me to study the cascading eﬀects between green and brown food webs thanks to light ﬁltration (direct manipulation of the green food web), the addition of dissolved organic carbon (direct manipulation of the brown food web) and the addition of ﬁsh (manipulation of food web structure). We did not observe any cascading eﬀects of the green food web on the brown food web and vice versa, probably because of a too low addition of dissolved carbon. The ﬁsh had a strong eﬀect on both green and brown food webs with positive eﬀects on phytoplankton when light is ﬁltered because of the decreased nutrient limitation thanks to ﬁsh excretion, an increased concentration of dissolved organic carbon and a change in the metabolic proﬁle of the benthic bacterial community. An additional model shows that the plasticity of metabolic rate, that is the ability of organisms to increase or decrease their metabolic rate depending on resource availability in order to optimise their energy budget, stabilises species dynamics in a food chain model by decreasing biomass time variability. Such a stabilising eﬀect results in increase of species persistence in a complex food web model. This thesis is an additional step to better link community ecology to functional ecology, thus improving our understanding of the consequences on food web stability of major ecosystem processes such as the nutrient cycling and the eﬀects of food web structure on ecosystem functioning.},

Efforts are underway to increase the resilience of some ecosystems that are under threat, yet collective awareness and action are modest at best. Here, we highlight the potential for a biosphere resilience sensing system to make it easier to see where things are going wrong, and to see whether deliberate efforts to make things better are working. We focus on global resilience sensing of the terrestrial biosphere at high spatial and temporal resolution through satellite remote sensing, utilizing the generic mathematical behaviour of complex systems—loss of resilience corresponds to slower recovery from perturbations, gain of resilience equates to faster recovery. We consider what subset of biosphere resilience remote sensing can monitor, critically reviewing existing studies. Then we present illustrative, global results for vegetation resilience and trends in resilience over the last 20 years, from both satellite data and model simulations. We close by discussing how resilience sensing nested across global, biome-ecoregion, and local ecosystem scales could aid management and governance at these different scales, and identify priorities for further work.

	abstract = {Patterning of vegetation in drylands is a consequence of localized feedback mechanisms. Such feedbacks also determine ecosystem resilience—­i.e. the ability to recover from perturbation. Hence, the patterning of vegetation has been hypothesized to be an indicator of resilience, that is, spots are less resilient than labyrinths. Previous studies have made this qualitative link and used models to quantitatively explore it, but few have quantitatively analysed available data to test the hypothesis. Here we provide methods for quantitatively monitoring the resilience of patterned vegetation, applied to 40 sites in the Sahel (a mix of previously identified and new ones). We show that an existing quantification of vegetation patterns in terms of a feature vector metric can effectively distinguish gaps, labyrinths, spots, and a novel category of spot–­labyrinths at their maximum extent, whereas NDVI does not. The feature vector pattern metric correlates with mean precipitation. We then explored two approaches to measuring resilience. First we treated the rainy season as a perturbation and examined the subsequent rate of decay of patterns and NDVI as possible measures of resilience. This showed faster decay rates—­conventionally interpreted as greater resilience—­associated with wetter, more vegetated sites. Second we detrended the seasonal cycle and examined temporal autocorrelation and variance of the residuals as possible measures of resilience. Autocorrelation and variance of our pattern metric increase with declining mean precipitation, consistent with loss of resilience. Thus, drier sites appear less resilient, but we find no significant correlation between the mean or maximum value of the pattern metric (and associated morphological pattern types) and either of our measures of resilience.},

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has been proposed as an efficient approach for inference with IBMs, but its applicability to data on natural populations has not been yet fully explored. We construct an IBM for the metapopulation dynamics of a species inhabiting a fragmented patch network, and develop an ABC method for parameterization of the model. We consider several scenarios of data availability from count data to combination of mark-recapture and genetic data. We analyse both simulated and real data on white-starred robin (Pogonocichla stellata), a passerine bird living in montane forest environment in Kenya, and assess how the amount and type of data affect the estimates of model parameters and indicators of population state. The indicators of the population state could be reliably estimated using the ABC method, but full parameterization was not achieved due to strong posterior correlations between model parameters. While the combination of the data types did not provide more accurate estimates for most of the indicators of population state or model parameters than the most informative data type (ringing data or genetic data) alone, the combined data allowed robust simultaneous estimation of all unknown quantities. Our results show that ABC methods provide a powerful and flexible technique for parameterizing complex IBMs with multiple data sources, and assessing the dynamics of the population in a robust manner.},

Conservation efforts have mainly focused on finding the direct causes, while paying less attention to building a systemic understanding of the fragility of these communities of pollinators. To fill this gap, we need operational measures of network resilience that integrate two different approaches in theoretical ecology. First, we should consider the range of conditions compatible with the stable coexistence of all of the species in a community. Second, we should address the rate and shape of network collapse once this safe operational space is exited. In this review, we describe this integrative approach and consider several mechanisms that may enhance the resilience of pollinator communities, chiefly rewiring the network of interactions, increasing heterogeneity, allowing variance, and enhancing coevolution. The most pressing need is to develop ways to reduce the gap between these theoretical recommendations and practical applications. This perspective shifts the emphasis from traditional approaches focusing on the equilibrium states to strategies that allow pollination networks to cope with global environmental change.},

Scale-dependent feedbacks provide the predominant conceptual framework for self-organized spatial patterns, explaining regular patterns observed in, e.g., arid ecosystems or mussel beds. Here, we highlight an alternative mechanism for self-organized patterns, based on the aggregation of a biotic or abiotic species, such as herbivores, sediment, or nutrients. Using a generalized mathematical model, we demonstrate that ecosystems with aggregation-driven patterns have fundamentally different dynamics and resilience properties than ecosystems with patterns that formed through scale-dependent feedbacks. Building on the physics theory for phase-separation dynamics, we show that patchy ecosystems with aggregation patterns are more vulnerable than systems with patterns formed through scale-dependent feedbacks, especially at small spatial scales. This is because local disturbances can trigger large-scale redistribution of resources, amplifying local degradation. Finally, we show that insights from physics, by providing mechanistic understanding of the initiation of aggregation patterns and their tendency to coarsen, provide a new indicator framework to signal proximity to ecological tipping points and subsequent ecosystem degradation for this class of patchy ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Humans depend on ecosystems for food, water, pharmaceuticals, and other benefits. Ecosystem managers, industries, and the public want these benefits to be predictable and therefore have low variance over time. However, control of variance for short-term benefits leads to long-term fragility. Here we show that management to reduce short-term variability can drive ecosystems into degraded states, leading to long-term declines of ecosystem services. These risks can be avoided by strategies that tolerate variability within boundaries of safe operating spaces for ecosystem management.
          , 
            Variable flows of food, water, or other ecosystem services complicate planning. Management strategies that decrease variability and increase predictability may therefore be preferred. However, actions to decrease variance over short timescales (2–4 y), when applied continuously, may lead to long-term ecosystem changes with adverse consequences. We investigated the effects of managing short-term variance in three well-understood models of ecosystem services: lake eutrophication, harvest of a wild population, and yield of domestic herbivores on a rangeland. In all cases, actions to decrease variance can increase the risk of crossing critical ecosystem thresholds, resulting in less desirable ecosystem states. Managing to decrease short-term variance creates ecosystem fragility by changing the boundaries of safe operating spaces, suppressing information needed for adaptive management, cancelling signals of declining resilience, and removing pressures that may build tolerance of stress. Thus, the management of variance interacts strongly and inseparably with the management of resilience. By allowing for variation, learning, and flexibility while observing change, managers can detect opportunities and problems as they develop while sustaining the capacity to deal with them.},

On isolated patches, diversity is always lost over time due to stabilising selection, and the local communities settle on one of two alternative stable community states that are characterised by a dominance of either defended or undefended species. In a metacommunity context, dispersal can destabilise these states and complex spatio-­temporal patterns in the species’ abundances emerge.

            The Turing, or reaction-diffusion (RD), model is one of the best-known theoretical models used to explain self-regulated pattern formation in the developing animal embryo. Although its real-world relevance was long debated, a number of compelling examples have gradually alleviated much of the skepticism surrounding the model. The RD model can generate a wide variety of spatial patterns, and mathematical studies have revealed the kinds of interactions required for each, giving this model the potential for application as an experimental working hypothesis in a wide variety of morphological phenomena. In this review, we describe the essence of this theory for experimental biologists unfamiliar with the model, using examples from experimental studies in which the RD model is effectively incorporated.},

Different metrics are used to assess the stability of ecological systems, and the choice of one metric over another may result in conflicting conclusions. Although each of the multitude of metrics is useful for answering a specific question about stability, the relationship among metrics is poorly understood. Such lack of understanding prevents scientists from developing a unified concept of stability. Instead, by investigating these relationships we can unveil how many dimensions of stability there are (i.e., in how many independent components stability metrics can be grouped), which should help build a more comprehensive concept of stability. Here we simultaneously measured 27 stability metrics frequently used in ecological studies. Our approach is based on dynamical simulations of multispecies trophic communities under different perturbation scenarios. Mapping the relationships between the metrics revealed that they can be lumped into 3 main groups of relatively independent stability components: early response to pulse, sensitivities to press, and distance to threshold. Selecting metrics from each of these groups allows a more accurate and comprehensive quantification of the overall stability of ecological communities. These results contribute to improving our understanding and assessment of stability in ecological communities.},

This concept focuses on stable states, yet many real communities are kept in a transient state by disturbance, and the utility of predictions for stable states in explaining transient states remains unclear. Using a simple model of plant community assembly, we show that the conditions under which historical contingency affects community assembly can differ greatly for stable versus transient states. Differences arise because the contribution of such factors as mortality rate, environmental heterogeneity and plant-soil feedback to historical contingency changes as community assembly proceeds. We also show that transient states can last for a long time relative to immigration rate and generation time. These results argue for a conceptual shift of focus from alternative stable states to alternative transient states for understanding historical contingency in community assembly.},

            Biocrusts cover {\textasciitilde}30\% of global drylands with a prominent role in the biogeochemical cycles. Theoretically, biocrusts, vascular plants, and bare soil can represent multiple stable states in drylands. However, no empirical evidence for the existence of a biocrust stable state has been reported. Here, using a global drylands dataset, we found that biocrusts form an alternative stable state (biocrust cover, {\textasciitilde}80\%; vascular cover, ≤10\%) besides bare soil (both biocrust and vascular cover, ≤10\%) and vascular plants (vascular cover, {\textgreater}50\%; biocrust cover, {\textasciitilde}5\%). The pattern of multiple stable states associated with biocrusts differs from the classic fold bifurcation, and values of the aridity index in the range of 0 to 0.6 define a bistable region where multiple stable states coexist. This study empirically demonstrates the existence and thresholds of multiple stable states associated with biocrusts along climatic gradients and thus may greatly contribute to conservation and restoration of global drylands.},

Less familiar, however, is that the majority of life cycle, seasonal and diel migrations in nature are partial migrations: only a fraction of the population migrates while the other individuals remain in their resident ecosystem. Here, we demonstrate different impacts of partial migration rendering it fundamental to our understanding of the significance of migration for food web and ecosystem dynamics. First, partial migration affects the spatiotemporal distribution of individuals and the food web and ecosystem-­level processes they drive differently than expected under full migration. Second, whether an individual migrates or not is regularly correlated with morphological, physiological, and/or behavioural traits that shape its food-­ web and ecosystem-­level impacts. Third, food web and ecosystem dynamics can drive the fraction of the population migrating, enabling the potential for feedbacks between the causes and consequences of migration within and across ecosystems. These impacts, individually and in combination, can yield unintuitive effects of migration and drive the dynamics, diversity and functions of ecosystems. By presenting the first full integration of partial migration and trophic (meta-­) community and (meta-­)ecosystem ecology, we provide a roadmap for studying how migration affects and is affected by ecosystem dynamics in a changing world.},

We propose several methodological developments to overcome the shortcomings of this MCMC approach and hence realize substantial computational advances over standard ABC. The principal idea is to relax the tolerance within MCMC to permit good mixing, but retain a good approximation to the posterior by a combination of subsampling the output and regression adjustment. We also propose to use a partial leastsquares (PLS) transformation to choose informative statistics. The accuracy of our approach is examined in the case of the divergence of two populations with and without migration. In that case, our ABC–MCMC approach needs considerably lower computation time to reach the same accuracy than conventional ABC. We then apply our method to a more complex case with the estimation of divergence times and migration rates between three African populations.},

Furthermore, for such a choice of bandwidth we can implement an importance sampling algorithm to sample from the ABC posterior whose acceptance probability tends to 1 as we increase the data sample size. This compares favorably to results for standard ABC, where the only way to obtain an ABC posterior that correctly quantiﬁes uncertainty is to choose a much smaller bandwidth, for which the acceptance probability tends to 0 and hence for which Monte Carlo error will dominate.},

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by ﬁtting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efﬁciency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difﬁculty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efﬁciency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efﬁciency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

Previous studies have often relied on ecological systems where the stressor (e.g. temperature, precipitation) is assumed to act homogeneously in space. Many ecological systems are, however, prone to spatially heterogeneous stresses (or ‘spatial stressors’), such as grazing, whose strength varies as a function of local vegetation patchiness. Here, we employed three well-studied spatially explicit ecological models to investigate how spatial stressors inﬂuence (a) the dynamics and resilience of ecosystems and (b) the robustness of early warnings of approaching ecosystem shifts. Mean-ﬁeld and numerical simulations of the models suggested that spatial stressors could aﬀect the stability and the number of equilibria of the system. Trends of spatial and temporal indicators were broadly consistent with the theory, i.e. they exhibited increasing trends as the system approached ecosystem shifts. However, in two of the three models, at high levels of spatial stress, spatial indicators could either exhibit trends opposite to those expected by the theory, or show no signals at all. Our results suggest that spatial stressors can interfere with the spatial patterns and thereby with the theoretically expected trends of early warning signals of ecosystem shifts. This highlights, once again, the importance of having a good knowledge of the ecosystem under study to be able to accurately interpret the indicator trends observed.},

This approach has undoubtedly led to a much better understanding of living systems but, equally, the staggering complexity of these systems, the sophistication and limitations of the techniques available in modern biology, and the need to use two or more techniques, can lead to persistent illusions of knowledge.

This intraspeciﬁc variation is likely to have large ecological consequences. We studied the ecological consequences of partial migration in a salmonid ﬁsh, Oncorhynchus mykiss, in coastal streams in California, USA. One ecotype, steelhead trout, migrates to the ocean, whereas the other, rainbow trout, completes its lifecycle in freshwater. Migration has a strong genetic basis in O. mykiss. In one stream, we found differences in the frequency of migration-linked genotypes below and above a waterfall barrier (migratory allele frequency of 60\% below vs. 31\% above). Below the waterfall, in the migratory-dominated region, the density of young ﬁsh ({\textless}1 yr old) was approximately twice that in the resident-dominated region above the waterfall (0.46 vs. 0.26 individuals/m2, respectively), presumably reﬂecting the higher fecundity of migratory females. Additionally, there were half as many older ﬁsh ({\textgreater}1 yr old) in pools downstream of the waterfall (0.05 vs. 0.13 individuals/m2). In a second stream, between-year variation in the dominance of migratory vs. resident ﬁsh allowed us to explore differences in ﬁsh density and size structure through time, and we found a consistent pattern. In brief, when migratory genotypes dominated, we found higher densities of young ﬁsh and lower densities of older ﬁsh, resulting in a simpler size structure, compared to when resident genotypes dominated. Moreover, large resident trout had a slightly higher trophic position than young ﬁsh (3.92 vs. 3.42 in one creek and 3.77 vs. 3.17 in the other), quantiﬁed with stable isotope data. The difference in ﬁsh size structure did not generate trophic cascades. Partial migration is widespread among migratory populations, as is phenotypic divergence between resident and migratory forms, suggesting the potential for widespread ecological effects arising from this common form of intraspeciﬁc variation.},

	abstract = {Trophic cascades are indirect positive effects of predators on resources via control of intermediate consumers. Larger-bodied predators appear to induce stronger trophic cascades (a greater rebound of resource density toward carrying capacity), but how this happens is unknown because we lack a clear depiction of how the strength of trophic cascades is determined. Using consumer resource models, we ﬁrst show that the strength of a trophic cascade has an upper limit set by the interaction strength between the basal trophic group and its consumer and that this limit is approached as the interaction strength between the consumer and its predator increases. We then express the strength of a trophic cascade explicitly in terms of predator body size and use two independent parameter sets to calculate how the strength of a trophic cascade depends on predator size. Both parameter sets predict a positive effect of predator size on the strength of a trophic cascade, driven mostly by the body size dependence of the interaction strength between the ﬁrst two trophic levels. Our results support previous empirical ﬁndings and suggest that the loss of larger predators will have greater consequences on trophic control and biomass structure in food webs than the loss of smaller predators.},

	abstract = {Many migratory species, from monarch butterﬂies to wildebeest, express partial migration, where only a subset of a population migrates. This intraspeciﬁc variation is likely to have large ecological consequences. We studied the ecological consequences of partial migration in a salmonid ﬁsh, Oncorhynchus mykiss, in coastal streams in California, USA. One ecotype, steelhead trout, migrates to the ocean, whereas the other, rainbow trout, completes its lifecycle in freshwater. Migration has a strong genetic basis in O. mykiss. In one stream, we found differences in the frequency of migration-linked genotypes below and above a waterfall barrier (migratory allele frequency of 60\% below vs. 31\% above). Below the waterfall, in the migratory-dominated region, the density of young ﬁsh ({\textless}1 yr old) was approximately twice that in the resident-dominated region above the waterfall (0.46 vs. 0.26 individuals/m2, respectively), presumably reﬂecting the higher fecundity of migratory females. Additionally, there were half as many older ﬁsh ({\textgreater}1 yr old) in pools downstream of the waterfall (0.05 vs. 0.13 individuals/m2). In a second stream, between-year variation in the dominance of migratory vs. resident ﬁsh allowed us to explore differences in ﬁsh density and size structure through time, and we found a consistent pattern. In brief, when migratory genotypes dominated, we found higher densities of young ﬁsh and lower densities of older ﬁsh, resulting in a simpler size structure, compared to when resident genotypes dominated. Moreover, large resident trout had a slightly higher trophic position than young ﬁsh (3.92 vs. 3.42 in one creek and 3.77 vs. 3.17 in the other), quantiﬁed with stable isotope data. The difference in ﬁsh size structure did not generate trophic cascades. Partial migration is widespread among migratory populations, as is phenotypic divergence between resident and migratory forms, suggesting the potential for widespread ecological effects arising from this common form of intraspeciﬁc variation.},

We used stable hydrogen isotopes in claw material to determine whether skylarks Alauda arvensis from a single breeding population in the Netherlands had migrated or remained resident in the previous winter and investigated whether there were causes or consequences of either strategy.

Instead, the wintering strategy is related to structural size and immune function.

            A fundamental dilemma in ecology is to reconcile the degree to which ecological processes are generalizable among taxa and ecosystems or determined primarily by taxonomic identity. We apply a unique dataset of organisms from a diverse marine community to test the applicability of two theories, metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and ecological stoichiometry (EST), and the role of taxonomic identity for predicting nutrient excretion rates by fishes and macroinvertebrates. Excretion rates were principally explained by body mass and taxonomic identity, providing strong support for MTE, but also highlighting the intrinsic importance of taxonomic identity. Little support for basic predictions of EST was found. This research reveals animal-mediated nutrient cycling is largely generalizable by metabolic processes, but refined predictions require taxa-specific understanding.

              Reconciling the degree to which ecological processes are generalizable among taxa and ecosystems, or contingent on the identity of interacting species, remains a critical challenge in ecology. Ecological stoichiometry (EST) and metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) are theoretical approaches used to evaluate how consumers mediate nutrient dynamics and energy flow through ecosystems. Recent theoretical work has explored the utility of these theories, but empirical tests in species-rich ecological communities remain scarce. Here we use an unprecedented dataset collected from fishes and dominant invertebrates (
              n
              = 900) in a diverse subtropical coastal marine community (50 families, 72 genera, 102 species; body mass range: 0.04–2,597 g) to test the utility of EST and MTE in predicting excretion rates of nitrogen (E
              N
              ), phosphorus (E
              P
              ), and their ratio (E
              NP
              ). Body mass explained a large amount of the variation in E
              N
              and E
              P
              but not E
              NP
              . Strong evidence in support of the MTE 3/4 allometric scaling coefficient was found for E
              P,
              and for E
              N
              only after accounting for variation in excretion rates among taxa. In all cases, including taxonomy in models substantially improved model performance, highlighting the importance of species identity for this ecosystem function. Body nutrient content and trophic position explained little of the variation in E
              N
              , E
              P
              , or E
              NP
              , indicating limited applicability of basic predictors of EST. These results highlight the overriding importance of MTE for predicting nutrient flow through organisms, but emphasize that these relationships still fall short of explaining the unique effects certain species can have on ecological processes.},

Feeding rates, as all biological rates, depend on consumer and resource body masses and environmental temperature. Despite five decades of research on functional responses as quantitative models of feeding rates, a unifying framework of how they scale with body masses and temperature is still lacking. This is perplexing, considering that the strength of functional responses (i.e. interaction strengths) is crucially important for the stability of simple consumer–resource systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of complex communities. Here, we present the largest currently available database on functional response parameters and their scaling with body mass and temperature. Moreover, these data are integrated across ecosystems and metabolic types of species. Surprisingly, we found general temperature dependencies that differed from the Arrhenius terms predicted by metabolic models. Additionally, the body-mass-scaling relationships were more complex than expected and differed across ecosystems and metabolic types. At local scales (taxonomically narrow groups of consumer–resource pairs), we found hump-shaped deviations from the temperature and body-mass-scaling relationships. Despite the complexity of our results, these body-mass- and temperature-scaling models remain useful as a mechanistic basis for predicting the consequences of warming for interaction strengths, population dynamics and network stability across communities differing in their size structure.},

Mass-speciﬁc P excretion rate varied 10-fold among taxa and was negatively related to animal body P content. In addition, the N : P ratio excreted was negatively related to body N : P. Body mass (negatively related to excretion rates) explained additional variance in these excretion parameters. Body P content and P excretion varied much more among taxonomic families than among species within families, suggesting that familial composition may strongly inﬂuence ecosystem-wide nutrient cycling.

Here we study the stability properties of spatially-arranged model food webs in which larger bodied species occupy higher trophic positions, while species’ body sizes also determine the rates at which they traverse spatial networks of heterogeneous habitat patches. Our analysis shows an apparent stabilizing effect of positive dispersal rate scaling with body size compared to negative scaling relationships or uniform dispersal. However, as the global coupling strength among patches increases, the benefits of positive body size-dispersal scaling disappear. A permutational analysis shows that breaking allometric dispersal hierarchies while preserving dispersal rate distributions rarely alters qualitative aspects of metacommunity stability. Taken together, these results suggest that the oft-predicted stabilizing effects of large mobile predators may, for some dimensions of ecological stability, be attributed to increased patch coupling per se, and not necessarily coupling by top trophic levels in particular.},

We further discuss the applications of GNNs across various  domains and summarize the open-source codes, benchmark data sets, and model  evaluation of GNNs.

Most existing models use emergent properties of food webs, such as diversity and connectance as parameters, to determine other food-web descriptors.

Here, we show that complex, realistic food webs may emerge by evolution from a single ancestor based on very simple ecological and evolutionary rules. In our model, adaptation acts on body size, whose impact on the metabolism and interactions of organisms is well established. Based on parameters defined at the organism scale, the model predicts emergent properties at the food-web scale. Variations of two key parameters (width of consumption niche and competition intensity) allow very different food-web structures and functionings to emerge, which are similar to those observed in some of the best-documented food webs.},

          Animals couple habitats by three types of movement: dispersal, migration, and foraging, which dynamically link populations, communities, and ecosystems. Spatial distances of movement tend to correlate with each other, reflecting shared allometric scaling with body size, but may diverge due to biomechanical, phylogenetic, and ecological constraints. While these constraints have been investigated within specific taxa, the macroecological and macroevolutionary constraints on movement distances, and causes of those constraints, are still unknown. Here, we synthesized distances of all three movement types across 300+ vertebrate species, and investigated how the relationships between movement types and body size were modified by movement medium, taxonomy, and trophic guild (carnivore, herbivore, etc.). We found that the strength of relationships between movement types and body size varied among environments, taxa, and trophic guilds. Movement profiles interacted with physiological, taxonomic, and ecological traits to depart from expected body mass scaling. Overall, we find that there are systematic patterns to movement distances, and that movement types with very distinct ecological consequences (foraging, migration) can be correlated and subject to similar constraints. This implies that the scales of population dynamics in ecological communities are not entirely determined by the environment and likely reflect general biomechanical, evolutionary and metabolic constraints.},

Using a nonlinear bioenergetic population-dynamic model that accounts for temperature and body-mass dependencies of biological rates, we analysed the individual and interactive effects of increasing temperature and nutrient enrichment on the dynamics of a three-species food chain. At low temperatures, warming counteracts the destabilizing effects of enrichment by both bottom-up (via the carrying capacity) and top-down (via biological rates) mechanisms. Together with increasing consumer body masses, warming increases the system tolerance to fertilization. Simultaneously, warming increases the risk of starvation for large species in low-fertility systems. This effect can be counteracted by increased fertilization. In combination, therefore, two main drivers of global change and biodiversity loss can have positive and negative effects on food chain stability. Our model incorporates the most recent empirical data and may thus be used as the basis for more complex forecasting models incorporating food-web structure.},

However, ecological consequences of temperature-size (TS) responses for community persistence under environmental change remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the interactive effects of warming, enrichment, community size structure and TS responses on a three-species food chain using a temperature-dependent model with empirical parameterisation. We found that TS responses often increase community persistence, mainly by modifying consumer-resource size ratios and thereby altering interaction strengths and energetic efficiencies. However, the sign and magnitude of these effects vary with warming and enrichment levels, TS responses of constituent species, and community size structure. We predict that the consequences of TS responses are stronger in aquatic than in terrestrial ecosystems, especially when species show different TS responses. We conclude that considering the links between phenotypic plasticity, environmental drivers and species interactions is crucial to better predict global change impacts on ecosystem diversity and stability.},

This contradiction has puzzled biologists for decades. While some have explored how stability may be achieved in small modules of a few interacting species, rigorous demonstrations of how large complex and ecologically realistic networks dynamically persist remain scarce and inadequately understood. Here, we help ﬁll this void by combining structural models of complex food webs with nonlinear bioenergetic models of population dynamics parameterized by biological rates that are allometrically scaled to populationsÕ average body masses. Increasing predator–prey body mass ratios increase population persistence up to a saturation level that is reached by invertebrate and ectotherm vertebrate predators when being 10 or 100 times larger than their prey respectively. These values are corroborated by empirical predator–prey body mass ratios from a global data base. Moreover, negative effects of diversity (i.e. species richness) on stability (i.e. population persistence) become neutral or positive relationships at these empirical ratios. These results demonstrate that the predator–prey body mass ratios found in nature may be key to enabling persistence of populations in complex food webs and stabilizing the diversity of natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Vegetation in dryland ecosystems often forms remarkable spatial patterns. These range from regular bands of vegetation alternating with bare ground, to vegetated spots and labyrinths, to regular gaps of bare ground within an otherwise continuous expanse of vegetation. It has been suggested that spotted vegetation patterns could indicate that collapse into a bare ground state is imminent, and the morphology of spatial vegetation patterns, therefore, represents a potentially valuable source of information on the proximity of regime shifts in dryland ecosystems. In this paper, we have developed quantitative methods to characterize the morphology of spatial patterns in dryland vegetation. Our approach is based on algorithmic techniques that have been used to classify pollen grains on the basis of textural patterning, and involves constructing feature vectors to quantify the shapes formed by vegetation patterns. We have analysed images of patterned vegetation produced by a computational model and a small set of satellite images from South Kordofan (South Sudan), which illustrates that our methods are applicable to both simulated and real-world data. Our approach provides a means of quantifying patterns that are frequently described using qualitative terminology, and could be used to classify vegetation patterns in large-scale satellite surveys of dryland ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Tidal salt marshes in the San Francisco Estuary region display heterogeneous vegetation patterns that inﬂuence wetland function and provide adequate habitat for native or endangered wildlife. In addition to analyzing the extent of vegetation, monitoring the dynamics of vegetation pattern within restoring wetlands can offer valuable information about the restoration process. Pattern metrics, derived from classiﬁed remotely sensed imagery, have been used to measure composition and conﬁguration of patches and landscapes, but they can be unpredictable across scales, and inconsistent across time. We sought to identify pattern metrics that are consistent across spatial scale and time – and thus robust measures of vegetation and habitat conﬁguration – for a restored tidal marsh in the San Francisco Bay, CA, USA. We used high-resolution (20 cm) remotely sensed color infrared imagery to map vegetation pattern over 2 years, and performed a multi-scale analysis of derived vegetation pattern metrics. We looked at the inﬂuence on metrics of changes in grain size through resampling and changes in minimum mapping unit (MMU) through smoothing. We examined composition, complexity, connectivity and heterogeneity metrics, focusing on perennial pickleweed (Sarcocornia paciﬁca), a dominant marsh plant. At our site, pickleweed patches grew larger, more irregularly shaped, and closely spaced over time, while the overall landscape became more diverse. Of the two scale factors examined, grain size was more consistent than MMU in terms of identifying relative change in composition and conﬁguration of wetland marsh vegetation over time. Most metrics exhibited unstable behavior with larger MMUs. With small MMUs, most metrics were consistent across grain sizes, from ﬁne (e.g. 0.16 m2) to relatively large (e.g. 16 m2) pixel sizes. Scale relationships were more variable at the landcover class level than at the landscape level (across all classes). This information may be useful to applied restoration practitioners, and adds to our general understanding of vegetation change in a restoring marsh.},

Simple random maps, maps with contagion (i.e., clusters of the same land cover type), and actual landscape data from USGS land use (LUDA) data maps were used in the analyses. Landscape patterns were compared using indices measuring diversity (H), dominance (D) and contagion (C). Rare land cover types were lost as grain became coarser. This loss could be predicted analytically for random maps with two land cover types, and it was observed in actual landscapes as grain was increased experimentally. However, the rate of loss was influenced by the spatial pattern. Land cover types that were clumped disappeared slowly or were retained with increasing grain, whereas cover types that were dispersed were lost rapidly. The diversity index decreased linearly with increasing grain size, but dominance and contagion did not show a linear relationship. The indices D and C increased with increasing extent, but H exhibited a variable response. The indices were sensitive to the number (m) of cover types observed in the data set and the fraction of the landscape occupied by each cover type (Pk); both m and Pk varied with grain and extent. Qualitative and quantitative changes in measurements across spatial scales will differ depending on how scale is defined. Characterizing the relationships between ecological measurements and the grain or extent of the data may make it possible to predict or correct for the loss of information with changes in spatial scale.},

Thus, understanding landscape structure and functioning requires multiscale information, and scaling functions are the most precise and concise way of quantifying multiscale characteristics explicitly. The major objective of this study was to explore if there are any scaling relations for landscape pattern when it is measured over a range of scales ͑grain size and extent͒. The results showed that the responses of landscape metrics to changing scale fell into two categories when computed at the class level ͑i.e., for individual land cover types͒: simple scaling functions and unpredictable behavior. Similarly, three categories were found at the landscape level, with the third being staircase pattern, in a previous study when all land cover types were combined together. In general, scaling relations were more variable at the class level than at the landscape level, and more consistent and predictable with changing grain size than with changing extent at both levels. Considering that the landscapes under study were quite diverse in terms of both composition and conﬁguration, these results seem robust. This study highlights the need for multiscale analysis in order to adequately characterize and monitor landscape heterogeneity, and provides insights into the scaling of landscape patterns.},

Mathematical models are often used to interpret experimental data and to estimate the parameters so that predictions can be made. Existing methods for parameter estimation typically assume that these parameters are constants and often ignore any uncertainty in the estimated values. We use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate the cell diffusivity, D, and the cell proliferation rate, λ, from a discrete model of collective cell spreading, and we quantify the uncertainty associated with these estimates using Bayesian inference. We use a detailed experimental data set describing the collective cell spreading of 3T3 ﬁbroblast cells. The ABC analysis is conducted for different combinations of initial cell densities and experimental times in two separate scenarios: (i) where collective cell spreading is driven by cell motility alone, and (ii) where collective cell spreading is driven by combined cell motility and cell proliferation. We ﬁnd that D can be estimated precisely, with a small coeﬃcient of variation (CV) of 2–6\%. Our results indicate that D appears to depend on the experimental time, which is a feature that has been previously overlooked. Assuming that the values of D are the same in both experimental scenarios, we use the information about D from the ﬁrst experimental scenario to obtain reasonably precise estimates of λ, with a CV between 4 and 12\%. Our estimates of D and λ are consistent with previously reported values; however, our method is based on a straightforward measurement of the position of the leading edge whereas previous approaches have involved expensive cell counting techniques. Additional insights gained using a fully Bayesian approach justify the computational cost, especially since it allows us to accommodate information from different experiments in a principled way.},

	abstract = {Background:  The root mycobiome plays a fundamental role in plant nutrition and protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. In temperate forests or meadows dominated by angiosperms, the numerous fungi involved in root symbioses are often shared between neighboring plants, thus forming complex plant-fungus interaction networks of weak specialization. Whether this weak specialization also holds in rich tropical communities with more phylogeneti‑cally diverse sets of plant lineages remains unknown. We collected roots of 30 plant species in semi-natural tropical communities including angiosperms, ferns, and lycophytes, in three different habitat types on La Réunion island: a recent lava flow, a wet thicket, and an ericoid shrubland. We identified root-inhabiting fungi by sequencing both the 18S rRNA and the ITS2 variable regions. We assessed the diversity of mycorrhizal fungal taxa according to plant spe‑cies and lineages, as well as the structure and specialization of the resulting plant-fungus networks.
Results:  The 18S and ITS2 datasets are highly complementary at revealing the root mycobiota. According to 18S, Glomeromycotina colonize all plant groups in all habitats forming the least specialized interactions, resulting in nested network structures, while Mucoromycotina (Endogonales) are more abundant in the wetland and show higher spe‑cialization and modularity compared to the former. According to ITS2, mycorrhizal fungi of Ericaceae and Orchidaceae, namely Helotiales, Sebacinales, and Cantharellales, also colonize the roots of most plant lineages, confirming that they are frequent endophytes. While Helotiales and Sebacinales present intermediate levels of specialization, Cantharellales are more specialized and more sporadic in their interactions with plants, resulting in highly modular networks.
Conclusions:  This study of the root mycobiome in tropical environments reinforces the idea that mycorrhizal fungal taxa are locally shared between co-occurring plants, including phylogenetically distant plants (e.g. lycophytes and angiosperms), where they may form functional mycorrhizae or establish endophytic colonization. Yet, we demon‑strate that, irrespectively of the environmental variations, the level of specialization significantly varies according to the fungal lineages, probably reflecting the different evolutionary origins of these plant-fungus symbioses. Frequent fungal sharing between plants questions the roles of the different fungi in community functioning and highlights the importance of considering networks of interactions rather than isolated hosts.},

              Once a population has converged on a consensus, how can a group with a minority viewpoint overturn it? Theoretical models have emphasized tipping points, whereby a sufficiently large minority can change the societal norm. Centola
              et al.
              devised a system to study this in controlled experiments. Groups of people who had achieved a consensus about the name of a person shown in a picture were individually exposed to a confederate who promoted a different name. The only incentive was to coordinate. When the number of confederates was roughly 25\% of the group, the opinion of the majority could be tipped to that of the minority.

          , 
            Theoretical models of critical mass have shown how minority groups can initiate social change dynamics in the emergence of new social conventions. Here, we study an artificial system of social conventions in which human subjects interact to establish a new coordination equilibrium. The findings provide direct empirical demonstration of the existence of a tipping point in the dynamics of changing social conventions. When minority groups reached the critical mass—that is, the critical group size for initiating social change—they were consistently able to overturn the established behavior. The size of the required critical mass is expected to vary based on theoretically identifiable features of a social setting. Our results show that the theoretically predicted dynamics of critical mass do in fact emerge as expected within an empirical system of social coordination.},

For instance, pathological beliefs can sustain psychiatric disorders, the belief that rhinoceros horn is an aphrodisiac may drive a species extinct, beliefs about gender or race may fuel discrimination, and belief in conspiracy theories can undermine democracy. Here, we present a unifying framework of how self-amplifying feedbacks shape the inertia of beliefs on levels ranging from neuronal networks to social systems. Sustained exposure to counterevidence can destabilize rigid beliefs but requires organized rational override as in cognitive behavioral therapy for pathological beliefs or institutional control of discrimination to reduce racial biases. Black-and-white thinking is a major risk factor for the formation of resilient beliefs associated with psychiatric disorders as well as prejudices and conspiracy thinking. Such dichotomous thinking is characteristic of a lack of cognitive resources, which may be exacerbated by stress. This could help explain why conspiracy thinking and psychiatric disorders tend to peak during crises. A corollary is that addressing social factors such as poverty, social cleavage, and lack of education may be the most effective way to prevent the emergence of rigid beliefs, and thus of problems ranging from psychiatric disorders to prejudices, conspiracy theories, and posttruth politics.},

Marine plankton form complex communities of interacting organisms at the base of the food web, which sustain oceanic biogeochemical cycles and help regulate climate. Although global surveys are starting to reveal ecological drivers underlying planktonic community structure and predicted climate change responses, it is unclear how community-scale species interactions will be affected by climate change. Here, we leveraged Tara Oceans sampling to infer a global ocean cross-domain plankton co-occurrence network?the community interactome?and used niche modeling to assess its vulnerabilities to environmental change. Globally, this revealed a plankton interactome self-organized latitudinally into marine biomes (Trades, Westerlies, Polar) and more connected poleward. Integrated niche modeling revealed biome-specific community interactome responses to environmental change and forecasted the most affected lineages for each community. These results provide baseline approaches to assess community structure and organismal interactions under climate scenarios while identifying plausible plankton bioindicators for ocean monitoring of climate change.},

	abstract = {Abstract Bipartite networks are widely used to represent a diverse range of species interactions, such as pollination, herbivory, parasitism and seed dispersal. The structure of these networks is usually characterised by calculating one or more indices that capture different aspects of network architecture. While these indices capture useful properties of networks, they are relatively insensitive to changes in network structure. Consequently, variation in ecologically-important interactions can be missed. Network motifs are a way to characterise network structure that is substantially more sensitive to changes in pairwise interactions and is gaining in popularity. However, there is no software available in R, the most popular programming language among ecologists, for conducting motif analyses in bipartite networks. Similarly, no mathematical formalisation of bipartite motifs has been developed. Here we introduce bmotif: a package for motif analyses of bipartite networks. Our code is primarily an r package, but we also provide matlab and Python code of the core functionality. The software is based on a mathematical framework where, for the first time, we derive formal expressions for motif frequencies and the frequencies with which species occur in different positions within motifs. This framework means that analyses with bmotif are fast, making motif methods compatible with the permutational approaches often used in network studies, such as null model analyses. We describe the package and demonstrate how it can be used to conduct ecological analyses, using two examples of plant?pollinator networks. We first use motifs to examine the assembly and disassembly of an Arctic plant?pollinator community and then use them to compare the roles of native and introduced plant species in an unrestored site in Mauritius. bmotif will enable motif analyses of a wide range of bipartite ecological networks, allowing future research to characterise these complex networks without discarding important meso-scale structural detail.},

            This study explores whether archaeologically detectable declines in resilience precede the onset of large-scale human population collapses. Our case study is the European Neolithic: a period that began approximately 9,000 y ago when the introduction of agricultural technologies initiated phases of rapid population growth that were in many cases followed by demographic instability and dramatic collapse. Our study finds evidence that statistical signatures of decreasing resilience can be detected long before population decline begins. To our knowledge, this study is the first to find early warning signals of demographic regime shift among human populations. The results suggest that archaeological information can potentially be used to monitor social and ecological vulnerability in human societies at large spatial and temporal scales.
          , 
            Ecosystems on the verge of major reorganization—regime shift—may exhibit declining resilience, which can be detected using a collection of generic statistical tests known as early warning signals (EWSs). This study explores whether EWSs anticipated human population collapse during the European Neolithic. It analyzes recent reconstructions of European Neolithic (8–4 kya) population trends that reveal regime shifts from a period of rapid growth following the introduction of agriculture to a period of instability and collapse. We find statistical support for EWSs in advance of population collapse. Seven of nine regional datasets exhibit increasing autocorrelation and variance leading up to collapse, suggesting that these societies began to recover from perturbation more slowly as resilience declined. We derive EWS statistics from a prehistoric population proxy based on summed archaeological radiocarbon date probability densities. We use simulation to validate our methods and show that sampling biases, atmospheric effects, radiocarbon calibration error, and taphonomic processes are unlikely to explain the observed EWS patterns. The implications of these results for understanding the dynamics of Neolithic ecosystems are discussed, and we present a general framework for analyzing societal regime shifts using EWS at large spatial and temporal scales. We suggest that our findings are consistent with an adaptive cycling model that highlights both the vulnerability and resilience of early European populations. We close by discussing the implications of the detection of EWS in human systems for archaeology and sustainability science.},

Here we propose a biophysical feedback responsible for differences in dune shape, and we investigate two, non-mutually exclusive ecological mechanisms for these differences: (1) species differ in their ability to capture sand and (2) species differ in their growth habit in response to sand deposition. To investigate sand capture, we used a moveable bed wind tunnel experiment and found that increasing tiller density increased sand capture efﬁciency and that, under different experimental densities, the native grass had higher sand capture efﬁciency compared to the Ammophila congeners. However, the greater densities of nonnative grasses under ﬁeld conditions suggest that they have greater potential to capture more sand overall. We used a mesocosm experiment to look at plant growth responses to sand deposition and found that, in response to increasing sand supply rates, A. arenaria produced higher-density vertical tillers (characteristic of higher sand capture efﬁciency), while A. breviligulata and E. mollis responded with lower-density lateral tiller growth (characteristic of lower sand capture efﬁciency). Combined, these experiments provide evidence for a species-speciﬁc effect on coastal dune shape. Understanding how dominant ecosystem engineers, especially nonnative ones, differ in their interactions with abiotic factors is necessary to better parameterize coastal vulnerability models and inform management practices related to both coastal protection ecosystem services and ecosystem restoration.},

	abstract = {Physical ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or indirectly control the availability of resources to other organisms by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. Physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is the physical modiﬁcation, maintenance, or creation of habitats. Ecological effects of engineers on many other species occur in virtually all ecosystems because the physical state changes directly create nonfood resources such as living space, directly control abiotic resources, and indirectly modulate abiotic forces that, in turn, affect resource use by other organisms. Trophic interactions and resource competition do not constitute engineering. Engineering can have signiﬁcant or trivial effects on other species, may involve the physical structure of an organism (like a tree) or structures made by an organism (like a beaver dam), and can, but does not invariably, have feedback effects on the engineer. We argue that engineering has both negative and positive effects on species richness and abundances at small scales, but the net effects are probably positive at larger scales encompassing engineered and nonengineered environments in ecological and evolutionary space and time. Models of the population dynamics of engineers suggest that the engineer/habitat equilibrium is often, but not always, locally stable and may show long-term cycles, with potential ramiﬁcations for community and ecosystem stability. As yet, data adequate to parameterize such a model do not exist for any engineer species. Because engineers control ﬂows of energy and materials but do not have to participate in these ﬂows, energy, mass, and stoichiometry do not appear to be useful in predicting which engineers will have big effects. Empirical observations suggest some potential generalizations about which species will be important engineers in which ecosystems. We point out some of the obvious, and not so obvious, ways in which engineering and trophic relations interact, and we call for greater research on physical ecosystem engineers, their impacts, and their interface with trophic relations. Key words: cascades, coupled trophic and engineering; community stability; ecosystem engineers; ecosystem function; feedbacks; habitat formation and destruction; population dynamics; positive and negative effects; species diversity.},

To bring together understanding of the role that beavers may play in the management of water resources, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems, this article reviews the state-of-the-art scientific understanding of the beaver as the quintessential ecosystem engineer. This review has a European focus but examines key research considering both Castor fiber—the Eurasian beaver and Castor canadensis—its North American counterpart. In recent decades species reintroductions across Europe, concurrent with natural expansion of refugia populations has led to the return of C. fiber to much of its European range with recent reviews estimating that the C. fiber population in Europe numbers over 1.5 million individuals. As such, there is an increasing need for understanding of the impacts of beaver in intensively populated and managed, contemporary European landscapes. This review summarizes how beaver impact: (a) ecosystem structure and geomorphology, (b) hydrology and water resources, (c) water quality, (d) freshwater ecology, and (e) humans and society. It concludes by examining future considerations that may need to be resolved as beavers further expand in the northern hemisphere with an emphasis upon the ecosystem services that they can provide and the associated management that will be necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize conflicts.},

	abstract = {Seagrass meadows are vital ecosystems in coastal zones worldwide, but are also under global threat. One of the major hurdles restricting the success of seagrass conservation and restoration is our limited understanding of ecological feedback mechanisms. In these ecosystems, multiple, self-reinforcing feedbacks can undermine conservation efforts by masking environmental impacts until the decline is precipitous, or alternatively they can inhibit seagrass recovery in spite of restoration efforts. However, no clear framework yet exists for identifying or dealing with feedbacks to improve the management of seagrass ecosystems. Here we review the causes and consequences of multiple feedbacks between seagrass and biotic and/or abiotic processes. We demonstrate how feedbacks have the potential to impose or reinforce regimes of either seagrass dominance or unvegetated substrate, and how the strength and importance of these feedbacks vary across environmental gradients. Although a myriad of feedbacks have now been identiﬁed, the co-occurrence and likely interaction among feedbacks has largely been overlooked to date due to difﬁculties in analysis and detection. Here we take a fundamental step forward by modelling the interactions among two distinct above- and belowground feedbacks to demonstrate that interacting feedbacks are likely to be important for ecosystem resilience. On this basis, we propose a ﬁve-step adaptive management plan to address feedback dynamics for effective conservation and restoration strategies. The management plan provides guidance to aid in the identiﬁcation and prioritisation of likely feedbacks in different seagrass ecosystems.},

	abstract = {There is a growing recognition of the important role of scale-dependent feedback for biogeomorphological landscape formation, where organisms locally improve survival and growth but at the same time negatively affect organisms at larger distance. However, little is known on how scale-dependent bio-geomorphic feedback is inﬂuenced by organism traits in combination with abiotic forcing. This was studied by measuring in a ﬂume, the ﬂow patterns around patches of three contrasting marsh species (Spartina anglica, Puccinellia maritima and Salicornia procumbens), using the ﬂow acceleration around vegetation patches and deceleration within vegetation patches as quantitative proxy for the negative and positive feedback to the vegetation performance. The importance of external forcing was assessed by comparing three realistic current velocities: 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 m s−1. Our results showed that the dense clonal growth of stiff Spartina anglica shoots caused strongest ﬂow deviations, irrespective of the applied current velocity. In contrast, the more sparsely growing, shorter stiff shoots of Salicornia procumbens induced much less ﬂow deviation, allowing more water to pass through and over the vegetation canopy. The dense but highly ﬂexible shoots of Puccinellia maritima caused strong ﬂow deviations at low velocities, which diminished at higher velocities due to bending of the vegetation. Overall, these hydrodynamic results demonstrate that plant species traits interact with environmental conditions in creating scale-dependent feedbacks explaining why the effects of vegetation on landscape formation in saltmarshes are species speciﬁc.},

Here, we joined ecological stoichiometry and the meta-ecosystem framework to understand how subsidy stoichiometry mediates the response of meta-ecosystem to subsidy flows. Our results demonstrate that resource flows between ecosystems can induce a positive spatial feedback loop, leading to higher production at meta-ecosystem scale by relaxing local ecosystem limitations (“spatial complementarity”). Furthermore, we show that spatial flows can also have an unexpected negative impact on production when accentuating the stoichiometric mismatch between local resources and basal species needs.

However, the inﬂuence of organism traits in combination with physical factors (e.g. hydrodynamics, sediments) on early establishment and successive development due to scale-dependent feedbacks is still unclear. As a model system, this was tested for salt marsh pioneer plants by conducting ﬂume experiments: i) on the inﬂuence of species-speciﬁc traits (such as stiffness) of two contrasting dominant pioneer species (Spartina alterniﬂora and Scirpus mariqueter) to withstand current-induced stress during establishment; and ii) to study the impact of species-speciﬁc traits (stiffness) and physical forcing (water level, current stress) on the large-scale negative feedback at established tussocks (induced scour at tussock edges) of the two model species.},

              In the past, when scientists encountered and studied ‘new’ environmental phenomena, they rarely considered the existing knowledge of First Peoples (also known as Indigenous or Aboriginal people). The scientific debate over the regularly spaced bare patches (so-called fairy circles) in arid grasslands of Australian deserts is a case in point. Previous researchers used remote sensing, numerical modelling, aerial images and field observations to propose that fairy circles arise from plant self-organization. Here we present Australian Aboriginal art and narratives, and soil excavation data, that suggest these regularly spaced, bare and hard circles in grasslands are pavement nests occupied by
              Drepanoterme
              s harvester termites. These circles, called
              linyji

              mingkirri
              (Warlpiri language), have been used by Aboriginal people in their food economies and for other domestic and sacred purposes across generations. Knowledge of the
              linyji
              has been encoded in demonstration and oral transmission, ritual art and ceremony and other media. While the exact origins of the bare circles are unclear, being buried in deep time and
              Jukurrpa
              , termites need to be incorporated as key players in a larger system of interactions between soil, water and grass. Ecologically transformative feedbacks across millennia of land use and manipulation by Aboriginal people must be accounted for. We argue that the co-production of knowledge can both improve the care and management of those systems and support intergenerational learning within and across diverse cultures.},

	abstract = {Dense vegetation bands aligned to contour levels and alternating at regular intervals with relatively barren interbands have been reported at the margins of all tropical deserts. Since their discovery in the 1950s, it has been supposed that these vegetation bands migrate upslope, forming a space–time cyclic pattern. Evidence to date has been relatively sparse and indirect, and observations have remained conﬂicting. Unequivocal photographic evidence of upslope migration (a few decimeters per year) is provided here for three independent dryland areas exhibiting periodic banded pattern: (1) the U.S. northeastern Chihuahuan Desert, (2) the Somalian Haud, and (3) the Mediterranean steppes of eastern Morocco. Migration speeds, averaged through time and space using Fourier cross-spectral analysis, are shown to be directly proportional to pattern scale (wavelength). A sequence of aerial photographs of the Chihuahuan Desert showed that migration was not continuous, but intermittent in response to ﬂuctuating weather regimes. The rates at which bands expanded upslope and contracted downslope were better predicted by the change in annual rainfall than by its average level. However, the migration of banded patterns cannot be considered as systematic because in our observations of three other banded systems located in the Somalian Haud, central Australia, and western New South Wales, migration was undetectable at the available image resolution. In each of the six sites under study, the modal value of band orientation axes was veriﬁed to be approximately orthogonal to the steepest slope. Our results underscore the importance of taking both the spatial structure and the past climate sequence into account for understanding vegetation dynamics in arid to semiarid ecosystems. In addition, we show how Fourier spectral analysis applied to historical series of optical images can serve to quantify landscape dynamics at a decadal time scale.},

Why do some parasites exhibit boom-­bust, oscillatory dynamics? What maintains parasite diversity, that is coinfection v single infection due to exclusion or priority effects? For insights on parasite dose, dynamics and diversity governing within-­host infection, we turn to niche models. An omnivory food web model (IGP) blueprints one parasite competing with immune cells for host energy (PIE). Similarly, a competition model (keystone predation, KP) mirrors a new coinfection model (2PIE). We then drew analogies between models using feedback loops. The following three points arise: first, like in IGP, parasites oscillate when longer loops through parasites, immune cells and resource regulate parasite growth. Shorter, self-­limitation loops (involving resources and enemies) stabilise those oscillations. Second, IGP can produce priority effects that resemble immune clearance. But, despite comparable loop structure, PIE cannot due to constraints imposed by production of immune cells. Third, despite somewhat different loop structure, KP and 2PIE share apparent and resource competition mechanisms that produce coexistence (coinfection) or priority effects of prey or parasites. Together, this mechanistic niche framework for within-­host dynamics offers new perspective to improve individual health.},

When subjected to stressors, each nested component of the pollination system (communities, populations, and colonies) can respond in either a smooth linear fashion, or in an abrupt nonlinear manner. Threshold and tipping point responses to stress are of particular concern because they result in sudden changes with little warning; such changes may lead to persistent non-functional states that are difficult to reverse. Here, we review evidence for threshold and tipping point responses at the colony, population and community levels of the pollination system. We find that while there are strong theoretical reasons to expect tipping point and threshold responses at all three levels of the pollination system, evidence in the field is lacking for all levels except the colony level. While this is encouraging, caution is still warranted as tipping point and threshold responses—by their very nature—may not be apparent until they are underway. Moreover, we propose that the interaction of nonlinear stress responses across different levels of the pollination system can increase the risk of cascading failures. We therefore suggest a cautious approach toward the management of pollination systems. Since environmental change will almost certainly continue to accelerate, understanding the potential for thresholds, tipping points and cascading failures is key to safeguarding global pollination systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Mutualistic interactions, such as plant-mycorrhizal or plant-pollinator interactions, are widespread in ecological communities and frequently exploited by cheaters, species that profit from interactions without providing benefits in return. Cheating usually negatively affects the fitness of the individuals that are cheated on, but the effects of cheating at community level remains poorly understood. Here we describe two different kinds of cheating in mutualistic networks and use a theoretical model to show that they have very different consequences for the persistence of the community. Conservative cheating, where a species cheats on its mutualistic partners to escape the cost of mutualistic interactions, negatively affects community persistence. In contrast, innovative cheating, which occurs when a species cheats with partners that it would otherwise not have access to, can enhance community persistence under some conditions. Innovative cheating becomes a stabilizing mechanism when cheaters have few mutualistic partners, cheat at low or intermediate frequency and when the cost associated with mutualism is not too high. In this case, the negative effects of cheating on partner persistence are over-compensated at the community level by the positive feedback loops that arise in mutualistic networks. Using an empirical dataset of plant-bird interactions, we found that observed cheating patterns are highly consistent with theoretical cheating patterns found to increase community persistence. This result suggests that eco-evolutionary dynamics tend to produce cheating patterns that increase the ecological stability of communities. Thus, cheating observed in nature could contribute to the stabilization of mutualistic communities instead of necessarily destabilizing them.},

The quantity and quality of subsidies are rapidly changing in response to stressors associated with global environmental change, but while we have models to predict the effects of changes in subsidy quantity, we currently lack models to predict the effects of changes in subsidy quality on recipient ecosystem functioning. We developed a novel model to predict the effects of subsidy quality on recipient ecosystem biomass distribution, recycling, production, and efficiency. We parameterized the model for a case study of a riparian ecosystem subsidized by pulsed emergent aquatic insects. In this case study we focused on a common measure of subsidy quality that differs between riparian and aquatic ecosystems: the higher content of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in aquatic ecosystems. We analyzed how changes in the PUFA concentration of aquatic subsidies affect the dynamics in biomass stocks and functions of the riparian ecosystem. We also conducted a global sensitivity analysis to identify key drivers of subsidy impacts. Our analysis showed that subsidy quality increased the functioning of the recipient ecosystem. Recycling increased more strongly than production per unit subsidy quality increase, meaning there was a threshold where an increase in subsidy quality led to stronger effects of subsidies on recycling relative to the production of the recipient ecosystem. Our predictions were most sensitive to basal nutrient input, highlighting the relevance of recipient ecosystem nutrient levels to understanding the effects of ecosystem connections. We argue that recipient ecosystems that rely on high-quality subsidies, such as aquatic–terrestrial ecotones, are highly sensitive to changes in subsidy–recipient ecosystem connections. Our novel model unifies the subsidy hypothesis and food quality hypothesis and provides testable predictions to understand the effects of ecosystem connections on ecosystem functioning under global changes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Here we synthesize empirical research using meta-analysis to compare how consumer and resource fluxes affect recipient food webs. We tested the following hypotheses: (H1) The direct effects of resource fluxes (bottom-up) should be stronger than the direct effects of consumer fluxes (top-down), because resource fluxes are permanent (do not return to the food web in which they were produced) but consumer fluxes may not be (consumers can leave). (H2) Following H1, the indirect effects should attenuate (weaken) more quickly for consumer fluxes than for resource fluxes due to their direct effects being weaker. (H3) The effects of resource fluxes should be stronger when recipient food webs are in different ecosystems than donor food webs due to differences in elevation that accompany cross-ecosystem food web interfaces, often increasing flux quantity due to gravity, while the effects of consumer fluxes should be stronger when donor and recipient food webs are in the same ecosystem as they should more easily assimilate into the recipient food web. We found no differences in the magnitude of bottom-up and top-down direct effects for resource and consumer fluxes, but top-down direct effects were 122\% stronger than top-down indirect effects. Indirect effects of prey and predator fluxes quickly attenuated while indirect effects of non-prey resource and herbivore fluxes did not, as the overall direct effects of prey and predator fluxes were 123\% and 163\% stronger than their indirect effects, respectively. This result suggests that the magnitude of indirect effects decrease as the trophic level of resource and consumer fluxes increases, and also contrasts with results from studies showing in situ top-down indirect effects are stronger than in situ bottom-up indirect effects. We found that resource and consumer flux effect sizes were similar when they occurred between ecosystems, but when they occurred within ecosystems predator flux effects were 107\% stronger than nutrient flux effects. Finally, we found that observational studies had higher effect sizes than manipulative studies. Future research should focus on how resource and consumer fluxes might interact and generate feedbacks in empirical studies of natural food webs, and what ecological factors might affect their relative strength.},

Investigation of this relationship between resilience and indirect effects leads to a better understanding of IEI, that it is actually a sum of three distinct components (IEI-cycle, IEI-mixed and IEI-pure), each of which is identified by their relation to cycling. IEI and FCI are highly correlated because both values increase with average path length path, which is the average number of compartments a unit flow material passes through before exiting the system. While IEI and FCI are highly correlated, the third component of IEI, IEI-pure, is totally uncorrelated with cycling.This is because the effects of cycling are excluded from IEI-pure, by definition.

            Understanding how environmental variation shapes vegetation distributions is crucial for predicting biosphere responses to global change. Savannas represent a major challenge, and repeated efforts have failed to constrain variation in savanna vegetation structure to a useful degree. Here, we find that trees cluster in savannas and that their clustering is governed by power laws, with parameters and geometries that are invariant to environment. This explains why savannas have resisted mechanistic characterization and offers a possible tool for constraining variability in vegetation structure.
          , 
            In savannas, predicting how vegetation varies is a longstanding challenge. Spatial patterning in vegetation may structure that variability, mediated by spatial interactions, including competition and facilitation. Here, we use unique high-resolution, spatially extensive data of tree distributions in an African savanna, derived from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), to examine tree-clustering patterns. We show that tree cluster sizes were governed by power laws over two to three orders of magnitude in spatial scale and that the parameters on their distributions were invariant with respect to underlying environment. Concluding that some universal process governs spatial patterns in tree distributions may be premature. However, we can say that, although the tree layer may look unpredictable locally, at scales relevant to prediction in, e.g., global vegetation models, vegetation is instead strongly structured by regular statistical distributions.},

However, we lack a comprehensive view of the likelihood of feedback-driven coexistence, partly because of a failure to analyse pairwise PSF, the metric directly linked to plant species coexistence. Here, we determine the relative importance of plant evolutionary history, traits, and environmental factors for coexistence through PSF using a meta-analysis of 1038 pairwise PSF measures. Consistent with eco-evolutionary predictions, feedback is more likely to mediate coexistence for pairs of plant species (1) associating with similar guilds of mycorrhizal fungi, (2) of increasing phylogenetic distance, and (3) interacting with native microbes. We also found evidence for a primary role of pathogens in feedback-mediated coexistence. By combining results over several independent studies, our results confirm that PSF may play a key role in plant species coexistence, species invasion, and the phylogenetic diversification of plant communities.},

	abstract = {Summary 1 Spatially periodic vegetation patterns are well known in arid and semi-arid regions around the world. 2 Mathematical models have been developed that attribute this phenomenon to a symmetry-breaking instability. Such models are based on the interplay between competitive and facilitative influences that the vegetation exerts on its own dynamics when it is constrained by arid conditions, but evidence for these predictions is still lacking. Moreover, not all models can account for the development of regularly spaced spots of bare ground in the absence of a soil prepattern. 3 We applied Fourier analysis to high-resolution, remotely sensed data taken at either end of a 40-year interval in southern Niger. Statistical comparisons based on this textural characterization gave us broad-scale evidence that the decrease in rainfall over recent decades in the sub-Saharan Sahel has been accompanied by a detectable shift from homogeneous vegetation cover to spotted patterns marked by a spatial frequency of about 20 cycles km?1. 4 Wood cutting and grazing by domestic animals have led to a much more marked transition in unprotected areas than in a protected reserve. 5 Field measurements demonstrated that the dominant spatial frequency was endogenous rather than reflecting the spatial variation of any pre-existing heterogeneity in soil properties. 6 All these results support the use of models that can account for periodic vegetation patterns without invoking substrate heterogeneity or anisotropy, and provide new elements for further developments, refinements and tests. 7 This study underlines the potential of studying vegetation pattern properties for monitoring climatic and human impacts on the extensive fragile areas bordering hot deserts. Explicit consideration of vegetation self-patterning may also improve our understanding of vegetation and climate interactions in arid areas.},

            We show that for thousands of years, humans have concentrated in a surprisingly narrow subset of Earth’s available climates, characterized by mean annual temperatures around ∼13 °C. This distribution likely reflects a human temperature niche related to fundamental constraints. We demonstrate that depending on scenarios of population growth and warming, over the coming 50 y, 1 to 3 billion people are projected to be left outside the climate conditions that have served humanity well over the past 6,000 y. Absent climate mitigation or migration, a substantial part of humanity will be exposed to mean annual temperatures warmer than nearly anywhere today.

            All species have an environmental niche, and despite technological advances, humans are unlikely to be an exception. Here, we demonstrate that for millennia, human populations have resided in the same narrow part of the climatic envelope available on the globe, characterized by a major mode around ∼11 °C to 15 °C mean annual temperature (MAT). Supporting the fundamental nature of this temperature niche, current production of crops and livestock is largely limited to the same conditions, and the same optimum has been found for agricultural and nonagricultural economic output of countries through analyses of year-to-year variation. We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 y than it has moved since 6000 BP. Populations will not simply track the shifting climate, as adaptation in situ may address some of the challenges, and many other factors affect decisions to migrate. Nevertheless, in the absence of migration, one third of the global population is projected to experience a MAT {\textgreater}29 °C currently found in only 0.8\% of the Earth’s land surface, mostly concentrated in the Sahara.

Location: Patagonian steppe, Argentina. Methods: We mapped vegetation under three different grazing conditions: ungrazed, lightly grazed and heavily grazed. We analysed the spatial patterns of the dominant life forms. Also, in each patch type, we determined density, species composition, richness, diversity, size structure and dead biomass of grasses under different grazing conditions. Results: The vegetation was spatially organized in a two-phase mosaic. High cover patches resulted from the association of grasses and shrubs and low cover patches were represented by scattered tussock grasses on bare ground. This spatial organization was not affected by grazing, but heavy grazing changed the grass species involved in high cover patches and reduced the density and cover of grasses in both patch types. Species richness and diversity in high cover patches decreased under grazing conditions, whereas in low cover patches it remained unchanged. Also, the decrease of palatable grasses was steeper in high cover patches than in low cover patches under grazing conditions. Conclusions: We suggest that although grazing promotes or inhibits particular species, it does not modify the mosaic structure of Patagonian steppe. The fact that the mosaic remained unchanged after 100 years of grazing suggests that grazing does not compromize population processes involved in maintaining patch structure, including seed dispersal, establishment or biotic interactions among life forms.},

Here, we show that physically self-organized mud cracking was an important facilitating process for the establishment of seepweeds in a “Red Beach” salt marsh in China. Transient mud cracks can promote plant survivorship by trapping seeds, and enhance germination and growth by increasing water infiltration in the soil, thus facilitating the formation of a persistent salt marsh landscape. Cracks can help the salt marsh withstand more intense droughts, leading to postponed collapse and faster recovery. These are indications of enhanced resilience. Our work highlights that self-organized landscapes sculpted by physical agents can play a critical role in ecosystem dynamics and resilience to climate change.

seepweeds in a “Red Beach” salt marsh in China. Transient mud cracks can promote plant survivorship by trapping seeds, and enhance germination and growth by increasing water infiltration in the soil, thus facilitating the
formation of a persistent salt marsh landscape. Cracks can help the salt marsh withstand more intense droughts,
leading to postponed collapse and faster recovery.

-historical reasons

	abstract = {Niche Theory is a central framework in ecology based on the recognition that most interactions between organisms are indirect, mediated by the biotic and abiotic dynamical environment these organisms live in. Despite its potential generality, the theory still mostly focuses on how resource–consumer dynamics mediate competition in ecological communities. However, it is being increasingly recognized that positive interactions between organisms also play an important role in driving the structure and functioning of ecological communities, from plants to microbes. In this paper, we present a unified theory of the niche that applies to both positive and negative interactions between organisms, mediated by one or two environmental factors. We show that classical concepts such as niche differences and fundamental and realized niches can naturally be expanded to facilitative and mutualistic interactions. In addition, we introduce and formalize new general niche concepts that appear exclusively in the presence of positive interactions: (1) the Allee niche, a region of environmental conditions for which a species can persist but not invade from low densities and (2) niche facilitation, when the presence of a species expands the set of environmental conditions under which a second species can invade and/or persist. To show the broad applicability of this theory, we illustrate these concepts using a diverse set of theoretical examples, from bacteria feeding on an inhibiting substrate, to nitrogen-fixing plants and the indirect mutualism between a plant and a carnivore species. In sum, our work shows how Niche Theory provides a natural framework for positive interactions in ecology, bringing a unified perspective and new conceptual tools to study ecological systems where these positive interactions occur.},

In this work, we consider tripartite networks constructed by merging two bipartite networks, one mutualistic and one antagonistic. Taking the interactions within each sub-network to be distributed randomly, we consider the stability of the dynamics of the network based on the spectrum of its community matrix. In the asymptotic limit of a large number of species, we show that the spectrum undergoes an eigenvalue phase transition, which leads to an abrupt destabilisation of the network as the ratio of mutualists to antagonists is increased. We also derive results that show how this transition is manifest in networks of ﬁnite size, as well as when disorder is introduced in the segregation of the two interaction types. Our random-matrix results will serve as a baseline for understanding the behaviour of merged networks with more realistic structures and/or more detailed dynamics.},

	abstract = {Prokaryotic heterotrophs (hereafter, bacteria) represent a large proportion of global biomass, and therefore bacterial biomass stoichiometry likely exerts control on global phosphorus (P), carbon (C), and nitrogen cycling and primary productivity. In this study we grew recently isolated freshwater heterotrophic bacteria across an ecologically relevant range of resource C:P ratios (organic C to P ratio in available resources) to quantify the P requirements of these organisms and examine the degree to which they regulated their P content under P-sufﬁcient and P-deﬁcient conditions. Bacterial biomass was only limited by P when resource C:P was greater than 250 (by atoms). Bacterial C:P ranged from 71 to 174 under P sufﬁciency and from 252 to 548 under P deﬁciency. Bacteria exhibited very little C:P homeostasis under P-sufﬁcient growth conditions, greater C:P homeostasis under P-deﬁcient conditions, and the ability of bacteria to outcompete one another in short-term experiments depended on a tradeoff between storing excess P for later use under P-deﬁcient conditions or immediately using P to produce more biomass. These results indicate that freshwater heterotrophic bacteria are not as P-rich as previously thought and that homeostatic regulation of C:P stoichiometry depends on the individual taxa and what resource (organic C or available P) is limiting bacterial growth. Individual bacterial populations can vary between strong C:P homeostasis under P deﬁciency to virtually no C:P homeostasis under P sufﬁciency, but variation between taxa and the effect this has on competitive ability may dampen the signal in C:PB at the bacterial community level. Nevertheless, the prevalence of homeostatic and non-homeostatic strategies in a bacterial community should have important implications for nutrient regeneration and carbon cycling.},

Systems are seen as either unconditionally or conditionally stable with little distinction and therefore much ambiguity in the likelihood of stability. First, we reexamine Hurwitz’s principal theorem for stability and propose two “Hurwitz criteria” that address different aspects of instability: positive feedback and insufﬁcient lower-level feedback. Second, we derive two qualitative metrics based on these criteria: weighted feedback (wFn) and weighted determinants (wDn). Third, we test the utility of these qualitative metrics through quantitative simulations in a random and evenly distributed parameter space in models of various sizes and complexities. Taken together they provide a practical means to assess the relative degree to which ambiguity has entered into calculations of stability as a result of system structure and complexity. From these metrics we identify two classes of models that may have signiﬁcant relevance to system research and management. This work helps to resolve some of the impasse between theoretical and empirical discussions on the complexity and stability of natural communities.},

Here, we use a systematic analytical framework to describe how assembly from a species pool gives rise to community network properties that differ from those of the pool: Compared to the pool, the community shows a bias towards higher carrying capacities, weaker competitive interactions and stronger beneficial interactions. Moreover, even if interactions between all pool species are completely random, community networks are more structured, with correlations between interspecies interactions, and between interactions and carrying capacities. Nonetheless, we show that these properties are not sufficient to explain the coexistence of all community species, and that it is a simple relation between interactions and species abundances that is responsible for the diversity within a community.},

	abstract = {Spatial vegetation patterns are recognized as sources of valuable information that can be used to infer the state and functionality of semiarid ecosystems, particularly in the context of both climate and land use change. Recent studies have suggested that the patch-size distribution of vegetation in drylands can be described using power-law metrics, and that these scale-free distributions deviate from power-law linearity with characteristic scale lengths under the effects of increasing aridity or human disturbance, providing an early sign of desertiﬁcation. These ﬁndings have been questioned by several modeling approaches, which have identiﬁed the presence of characteristic scale lengths on the patch-size distribution of semiarid periodic landscapes. We analyze the relationship between fragmentation of vegetation patterns and their patch-size distributions in semiarid landscapes showing different degree of periodicity (i.e., banding). Our assessment is based on the study of vegetation patterns derived from remote sensing in a series of semiarid Australian Mulga shrublands subjected to different disturbance levels. We use the patch-size probability density and cumulative probability distribution functions from both nondirectional and downslope analyses of the vegetation patterns. Our results indicate that the shape of the patch-size distribution of vegetation changes with the methodology of analysis applied and speciﬁc landscape traits, breaking the universal applicability of the power-law metrics. Characteristic scale lengths are detected in (quasi ) periodic banded ecosystems when the methodology of analysis accounts for critical landscape anisotropies, using downslope transects in the direction of ﬂow paths. In addition, a common signal of fragmentation is observed: the largest vegetation patches become increasingly less abundant under the effects of disturbance. This effect also explains deviations from power-law behavior in disturbed vegetation which originally showed scale-free patterns. Overall, our results emphasize the complexity of structure assessment in dryland ecosystems, while recognizing the usefulness of the patch-size distribution of vegetation for monitoring semiarid ecosystems, especially through the cumulative probability distributions, which showed high sensitivity to fragmentation of the vegetation patterns. We suggest that preserving large vegetation patches is a critical task for the maintenance of the ecosystem structure and functionality.},

	abstract = {Identifying the mechanisms and interactions that inﬂuence the spatial structure of vegetation is important for both scientiﬁc and practical purposes. Grazing is one of the most fundamental interactions in ecology but so far its effect on vegetation spatial pattern received little attention. In this study we propose a conceptual model that can be used to predict the effect of grazing on shrub spatial pattern in water-limited ecosystems where shrubs grow within a matrix of annual vegetation. According to the model, grazing may increase or decrease clumping in shrub distribution, depending on (1) the relative palatability of shrubs vs. annual plants to the herbivores, and (2) the manner (negative or positive) by which adult shrubs and annual plants affect the establishment of shrub seedlings. We tested our model in a Mediterranean scrub ecosystem by analyzing the development of shrub spatial pattern over a period of 40 years in plots characterized by contrasting intensities of cattle grazing. As predicted by the model, all plots showed a clumped pattern of shrub distribution in the absence of cattle grazing while intense cattle grazing reduced the clumpiness of the vegetation and generated a more random pattern of shrub distribution. Interestingly, plots representing the two grazing regimes did not differ signiﬁcantly in their shrub cover, suggesting that shrub spatial pattern may be more sensitive to grazing than overall shrub cover.},

With introduction of cattle, there was a tendency of shrubs to become more randomly distributed in the landscape compared to when not grazed

The goal of this analysis is to identify those conditions in which engineering leads to population dynamics that are qualitatively different than one would predict using models that incorporate only biotic interactions. We present a simple model coupling an ecosystem engineer and the abiotic environment. We assume that the engineer alters environmental conditions at a rate dependent on engineer density and that the environment decays back to original conditions at an exponential rate. We determine when the feedback to population dynamics through environmental state can lead to altered equilibrium densities, bistability, or runaway growth of the engineer population. The conditions leading to changes in dynamics, such as susceptibility of a system to engineering or alteration of density-dependent and density-independent controls, deﬁne cases in which the engineering concept is essential for ecological understanding.},

Sixteen pens with emigration traps were built in a side-channel of the Mamquam River, British Columbia. Pens were randomly assigned salmon carcasses, in-stream wood, both carcasses and in-stream wood, or neither (control). Our first trial was conducted between December 1996 and August 1997 and the second between December 1997 and August 1998. Initial rearing densities and average individual body mass were 3.1 fish·m–2 and 2.4 g, respectively, in the first trial and were 1.6 fish·m–2 and 6.6 g, respectively, in the second trial. Results were influenced by both fish initial size and density. During the first trial (smaller-sized fish at high densities), salmon carcasses increased fish growth rates and presmolt size. Winter survival did not increase in response to any treatment; however, a pre-winter size-related survival pattern was observed during the first trial. During the second trial, (larger-sized fish at low densities), no treatment influenced fish growth rates or presmolt size but all treatments augmented fish survival.},

	abstract = {Recent research has identiﬁed the connectivity of the bare-soil interpatch areas as a key pattern attribute that controls resource conservation and structure-function feedbacks in dryland ecosystems, and several indices have been developed for this attribute. We aimed to characterize the dependence of bare-soil connectivity on vegetation cover and provide a null model that helps diﬀerentiate the independent roles of vegetation pattern and cover in hydrological connectivity and dryland functioning. Using a simple hydrological connectivity index, Flowlength, we developed explicit theoretical expressions for its expected value and variance under a null model of random vegetation cover distribution and constant slope. We also obtained the expected value of Flowlength for a model including an aggregation parameter. We found a non-linear inverse relationship between bare-soil connectivity and vegetation cover, which accounts for sharp increases in runoﬀ and sediment yield for low cover values. The expressions for the mean values and standard errors for the random model allow the construction of conﬁdence intervals, and thus testing for deviations from the null random model in experimental data. We found that positive deviations of Flowlength from the expected values, either under random or aggregated-pattern null models, sharply increase before transitions to a degraded state in a spatially-explicit dryland vegetation model, suggesting that an extraordinary increase in bare-soil connectivity may lead to unavoidable degradation. Our results show that increased deviation from the expected cover-dependent bare-soil connectivity may serve as indicator of ecosystem functional status and imminent transitions.},

The aim is to present to the Earth Science community ecological and evolutionary concepts and associated recent conceptual developments for linking geomorphology and biota. The novelty of the proposed perspective is that (1) in the presence of geomorphologic-engineer species, which modify sediment and landform dynamics, natural selection operating at the scale of organisms may have consequences for the physical components of ecosystems, and particularly Earth surface processes and landforms; and (2) in return, these modiﬁcations of geomorphologic processes and landforms often feed back to the ecological characteristics of the ecosystem (structure and function) and thus to biological characteristics of engineer species and/or other species (adaptation and speciation). The main foundation concepts from ecology and evolutionary biology which have led only recently to an improved conception of landform dynamics in geomorphology are reviewed and discussed. The biogeomorphologic macroevolutionary insights proposed explicitly integrate geomorphologic niche-dimensions and processes within an ecosystem framework and reﬂect current theories of ecoevolutionary and ecological processes. Collectively, these lead to the deﬁnition of an integrated model describing the overall functioning of biogeomorphologic systems over ecological and evolutionary timescales. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {River ecological functioning can be conceptualized according to a four-dimensional framework, based on the responses of aquatic and riparian communities to hydrogeomorphic constraints along the longitudinal, transverse, vertical and temporal dimensions of rivers. Contemporary riparian vegetation responds to river dynamics at ecological timescales, but riparian vegetation, in one form or another, has existed on Earth since at least the Middle Ordovician (c. 450 Ma) and has been a significant controlling factor on river geomorphology since the Late Silurian (c. 420 Ma). On such evolutionary timescales, plant adaptations to the fluvial environment and the subsequent effects of these adaptations on fluvial sediment and landform dynamics resulted in the emergence, from the Silurian to the Carboniferous, of a variety of contrasted fluvial biogeomorphic types where water flow, morphodynamics and vegetation interacted to different degrees.

	abstract = {Biotic influences on geomorphology (and vice-versa) are ubiquitous. This paper explores whether landforms may be extended (composite) phenotypes of biota, based on four criteria: process–form relationships between biota and landforms; evolutionary synchrony; selective pressure via ecosystem engineering and niche construction; and positive feedback benefitting the engineer organism(s). Coral reefs, peat bogs, biomantles, insect mounds, grassland soils, salt marshes, mangrove swamps, and some vegetation-dependent sand dune types clearly meet these criteria. Karst landforms, meandering rivers, and tree uprooting pitmound systems meet the first three criteria, but positive feedback to engineer organisms has not been established. Research in biogeomorphology will surely identify other extended phenotypes. Implications are that biological evolution will continue to drive landscape metamorphosis, the appearance of new landform types, and presumably the disappearance of extended phenotypes associated with extinct species. Independently of extended phenotypes, tightly-coupled geomorphological–ecological interactions such as coevolution, and biogeomorphic forms of ecosystem engineering and niche construction are common. The toposphere, encompassing Earth’s landforms, is partly a biotic construct. Some elements would be present in an abiotic world, but the toposphere would not exist in anything resembling its contemporary state without a biosphere. This raises important questions with respect to Earth system evolution. The bio, litho-, atmo-, hydro-, topo-, and pedospheres coevolve at the global scale. Major biotic events have driven revolutions in the other spheres, but the atmosphere and the global hydrological system seem to have been relatively steadystate at the global scale. The toposphere and pedosphere have not. This suggests that perhaps landforms and soils provide the major mechanisms or degrees of freedom by which Earth responds to biological evolution. Landforms and soils may thus be the ‘voice’ of the biosphere as it authors planetary change, even if clear biotic signatures are lacking. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Such catastrophic shifts are difﬁcult to predict and sometimes to reverse (so-called hysteresis). While well studied in simpliﬁed contexts, we lack a general understanding of how catastrophic shifts spread in realistically spatially structured landscapes. For different types of landscape structures, including typical terrestrial modular and riverine dendritic networks, we here investigate landscape-scale stability in metapopulations whose patches can locally exhibit catastrophic shifts. We ﬁnd that such metapopulations usually exhibit large-scale catastrophic shifts and hysteresis and that the properties of these shifts depend strongly on the metapopulation spatial structure and on the population dispersal rate: an intermediate dispersal rate, a low average degree, or a riverine spatial structure can largely reduce hysteresis size. Our study suggests that largescale restoration is easier with spatially clustered restoration efforts and in populations characterized by an intermediate dispersal rate.},

Because most works focus either on mutualism or predation, how pollination and herbivory interactively determine the stable coexistence in plant-pollinatorherbivore communities is still poorly understood. Studying the typical three-species module of such commu­ nities, we determine the conditions allowing stable coexistence then investigate how its maintenance constrains the relative interaction strengths. Our results show that coexistence is possible if pollination is sufficiently strong relative to herbivory, while its stability is possible if herbivory is sufficiently strong relative to pollination. A balance between pollination and herbivory is therefore required. Interestingly, shared preferences for plant phenotypes, that would favor such balance, have been frequently reported in the empirical literature. The identified ecological trade-off between attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores therefore also appears as an emergent property of stable plant-pollinator-herbivore communities.},

Here,  we introduce a resource-explicit, community assembly model of N-fixing species  and analyze successional trajectories along resource availability gradients using  contemporary niche theory. We show that facilitation-driven succession occurs  under low N and high enough P availabilities, and is characterised by autogenic  ecosystem development and relatively ordered trajectories. We show that late  facilitation-driven succession is sensitive to catastrophic shifts, highlighting  the need to invoke other mechanisms to explain ecosystem stability near the  climax.

Key point in collapse litterature = timescales

For instance takes decade in Mycenaea societies but centuries for the Maya.
Collapse = sometimes opportunities for other societies. For instance, in the case of colonial empires.

1/ environmental change, endogeneous (e.g., for Rome, or with loss of trust, corruption, unsustainable inequalities etc..)  
Consequences

Tipping point: suddently shift in system behavior. the transformation is irreversible and persistent

Feedback loop breakdown: (e.g., rewarding system with encouragment and discouragment of doing something)

Contagions: passing of object, nutrients and viruses through a network -{\textgreater} travelling waves, shocks that would otherwise be isolated

Cascades:  
Domino effect through the network of connected entities. (e.g. assassination of Franz Ferdinand in 1914 leading to WWI)


Synchronous failures:

This is due to rising autocorrelation near transition. There is a synchrony of the system

Cycles
For over a half-century, economic policy has been guided by attempts to regulate the cyclical nature of inflation and unemployment, booms, and busts. The central 
notion of Keynesianism is to avoid the deep troughs of the cycle through 
monetary and fiscal intervention

Robustness and Resilience

might be trade-offs between both. They are both public oods, eroded by the lack of trust. 
This can lead to the tragedy of the commomns where short-run self-interest rather than coordination and cooperation can lead to systemic failure.

Can also be eroded if a central node focuses on its local connexions rather than on all system

Understanding the relationship between complexity and stability of ecosystems is of key importance for the maintenance of the balance of human growth and the conservation of all the natural services that ecosystems provide. Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement. The summary of the importance of this line of research for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services concludes the review.},

          , 
            The human gut harbors a large and complex community of beneficial microbes that remain stable over long periods. This stability is considered critical for good health but is poorly understood. Here we develop a body of ecological theory to help us understand microbiome stability. Although cooperating networks of microbes can be efficient, we find that they are often unstable. Counterintuitively, this finding indicates that hosts can benefit from microbial competition when this competition dampens cooperative networks and increases stability. More generally, stability is promoted by limiting positive feedbacks and weakening ecological interactions. We have analyzed host mechanisms for maintaining stability—including immune suppression, spatial structuring, and feeding of community members—and support our key predictions with recent data.},

            Political polarization threatens democracy in America. This article helps illuminate what drives it, as well as what factors account for its asymmetric nature. In particular, we focus on positive feedback among members of Congress as the key mechanism of polarization. We show how public opinion, which responds to the laws legislators make, in turn drives the feedback dynamics of political elites. Specifically, we find that voters’ “policy mood,” i.e., whether public opinion leans in a more liberal or conservative direction, drives asymmetries in elite polarization over time. Our model also demonstrates that once self-reinforcing processes among elites reach a critical threshold, polarization rapidly accelerates. By tying together elite and voter dynamics, this paper presents a unified theory of political polarization.
          , 
            Using a general model of opinion dynamics, we conduct a systematic investigation of key mechanisms driving elite polarization in the United States. We demonstrate that the self-reinforcing nature of elite-level processes can explain this polarization, with voter preferences accounting for its asymmetric nature. Our analysis suggests that subtle differences in the frequency and amplitude with which public opinion shifts left and right over time may have a differential effect on the self-reinforcing processes of elites, causing Republicans to polarize more quickly than Democrats. We find that as self-reinforcement approaches a critical threshold, polarization speeds up. Republicans appear to have crossed that threshold while Democrats are currently approaching it.},

Yet, topological properties identified across these networks may not be sufficiently attributable to ecological processes alone as often assumed. Instead, much of the totality of topological differences between networks—topological heterogeneity—could be due to variations in research designs and approaches that different researchers use to create each species interaction network. To evaluate the degree to which this topological heterogeneity is present in available ecological networks, we first compared the amount of topological heterogeneity across 723 species interaction networks created by different sets of researchers with the amount quantified from non-ecological networks known to be constructed following more consistent approaches. Then, to further test whether the topological heterogeneity was due to differences in study designs, and not only to inherent variation within ecological networks, we compared the amount of topological heterogeneity between species interaction networks created by the same sets of researchers (i.e., networks from the same publication) with the amount quantified between networks that were each from a unique publication source. We found that species interaction networks are highly topologically heterogeneous: while species interaction networks from the same publication are much more topologically similar to each other than interaction networks that are from a unique publication, they still show at least twice as much heterogeneity as any category of non-ecological networks that we tested. Altogether, our findings suggest that extra care is necessary to effectively analyze species interaction networks created by different researchers, perhaps by controlling for the publication source of each network.},

            As complex systems such as the climate or ecosystems approach a tipping point, their dynamics tend to become dominated by a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. Using time series of autorecorded mood, we show that indicators of slowing down are also predictive of future transitions in depression. Specifically, in persons who are more likely to have a future transition, mood dynamics are slower and different aspects of mood are more correlated. This supports the view that the mood system may have tipping points where reinforcing feedbacks among a web of symptoms can propagate a person into a disorder. Our findings suggest the possibility of early warning systems for psychiatric disorders, using smartphone-based mood monitoring.

            About 17\% of humanity goes through an episode of major depression at some point in their lifetime. Despite the enormous societal costs of this incapacitating disorder, it is largely unknown how the likelihood of falling into a depressive episode can be assessed. Here, we show for a large group of healthy individuals and patients that the probability of an upcoming shift between a depressed and a normal state is related to elevated temporal autocorrelation, variance, and correlation between emotions in fluctuations of autorecorded emotions. These are indicators of the general phenomenon of critical slowing down, which is expected to occur when a system approaches a tipping point. Our results support the hypothesis that mood may have alternative stable states separated by tipping points, and suggest an approach for assessing the likelihood of transitions into and out of depression.},

Fractal measurements of spatial patterns, such as the Korcak exponent or boundary dimension, have been proposed as indicators of the persistence of underlying dynamics. Here we explore under what conditions a predictive relationship between fractal measures and persistence exists. We combine theoretical arguments with an aerial snapshot and time series from a long-term study of seagrass. For this form of vegetative growth, we find that the expected relationship between the Korcak exponent and persistence is evident at survey sites where the population return rate can be measured. This highlights a limitation of the use of power-law patch-size distributions and other indicators based on spatial snapshots. Moreover, our numeric simulations show that for a single species and a range of environmental conditions that the Korcak–persistence relationship provides a link between temporal dynamics and spatial pattern; however, this relationship is specific to demographic factors, so we cannot use this methodology to compare between species.},

Most critically, the biodiversity of wetlands is intimately linked to its hydrologic dynamics, which in turn are being drastically altered by ongoing climate changes. Hydroperiod regimes, e.g., percentage of time a site is inundated, exert critical control in the creation of niches for different plant species in wetlands. However, the spatial signatures of the organization of plant species in wetlands and how the different drivers interact to yield such signatures are unknown. Focusing on Everglades National Park (ENP) in Florida, we show here that cluster sizes of each species follow a power law probability distribution and that such clusters have well-defined fractal characteristics. Moreover, we individuate and model those signatures via the interplay between global forcings arising from the hydroperiod regime and local controls exerted by neighboring vegetation. With power law clustering often associated with systems near critical transitions, our findings are highly relevant for the management of wetland ecosystems. In addition, our results show that changes in climate and land management have a quantifiable predictable impact on the type of vegetation and its spatial organization in wetlands.},

Yet, resource exchanges at heterotrophic-­ autotrophic (e.g. aquatic-­terrestrial) ecotones display a stoichiometric asymmetry that likely matters for functioning. Here, we joined ecological stoichiometry and the meta-­ecosystem framework to understand how subsidy stoichiometry mediates the response of the meta-­ecosystem to subsidy flows. Our model results demonstrate that resource flows between ecosystems can induce a positive spatial feedback loop, leading to higher production at the meta-­ecosystem scale by relaxing local ecosystem limitations (‘spatial complementarity’). Furthermore, we show that spatial flows can also have an unexpected negative impact on production when accentuating the stoichiometric mismatch between local resources and basal species needs.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04096},
	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation is a statistical framework that uses numerical simulations to calibrate and compare models. Instead of computing likelihood functions, Approximate Bayesian computation relies on numerical simulations, which makes it applicable to complex models in ecology and evolution. As usual for statistical modeling, evaluating goodness-of-fit is a fundamental step for Approximate Bayesian Computation. Here, we introduce a goodness-of-fit approach based on hypothesis-testing. We introduce two test statistics based on the mean distance between numerical summaries of the data and simulated ones. One test statistic relies on summaries simulated with the prior predictive distribution whereas the other one relies on simulations from the posterior predictive distribution. For different coalescent models, we find that the statistics are well calibrated, meaning that the type I error can be controlled. However, the statistical power of the two statistics is extremely variable across models ranging from 20\% to 100\%. The difference of power between the two statistics is negligible in models of demographic inference but substantial in an additional and purely statistical example. When analyzing resequencing data to evaluate models of human demography, the two statistics confirm that an out-of-Africa bottleneck cannot be rejected for Asiatic and European data. We also consider two speciation models in the context of a butterfly species complex. One goodness-of-fit statistic indicates a poor fit for both models, and the numerical summaries causing the poor fit were identified using posterior predictive checks. Statistical tests for goodness-of-fit should foster evaluation of model fit in Approximate Bayesian Computation. The test statistic based on simulations from the prior predictive distribution is implemented in the gfit function of the R abc package.},
